There have also been reports about how they have bonded over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the similarities they share</a>. This <a href=#>includes being single parents</a>.</p><p>"They have a lot in common," a source told Us Weekly in October 2023, when they were first linked. "They're both single parents to a young daughter, and they share a similar sense of humor." A source also claimed the model was "really enjoying spending time" with Cooper.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gigi-hadid-and-bradley-cooper.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Sources Clarify Gigi Hadid Will Skip The Oscars After Reports She'd Be Walking The Red Carpet With Bradley Cooper">Sources Clarify Gigi Hadid Will Skip The Oscars After Reports She'd Be Walking The Red Carpet With Bradley Cooper</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Gigi Hadid won't be making an appearance with Bradley Cooper neither at the awards ceremony nor at any of the after parties.</p><p>There was also the suggestion that they were open to letting their partners meet their children (although the relationship was still new at the time of the report). Hadid "has no intention of introducing Khai to anybody she dates unless she's in a fully committed relationship," the source claimed, adding she was "open to the idea of getting to know [Cooper] better." The source continued, "It's still far too early to know where things might be headed," and "Things aren't that serious right now, the attraction is there." It's been over six months since that report, and the couple is still going strong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq5mUobK6ecKopqmdomK0qrPIZp%2BanJmZerO7zJqlnJ1dnbKiwNJmmK2slaOxbrLErKCtrpGhfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hana-mandlikova-daughter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hana Mandlikova Daughter: A Rising Tennis Star">&larr;
