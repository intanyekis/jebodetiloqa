Here are our top five guesses:</p><h3>1. Wren Kingston</h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span><br>No one has been a peripheral member of the “A” game longer than Wren (Julian Morris), who conveniently showed up just as the girls began receiving threatening messages in the pilot episode. He easily could have blackmailed Melissa Hastings (Torrey DeVitto) into dating him after he found out that she was Bethany’s real killer, which provides him with a convenient cover story. As far as appearance goes, he looks passable as a member of the DiLaurentis family, and a simple bottle of hair dye could explain the brunette locks. By volunteering at Radley Sanitarium, he was able to destroy his own files and had access to those of Spencer and Mona Vanderwaal (Janel Parrish).</p><p>Plus, there’s the fact that the charming British actor Morris has a history of playing murderers (“Sorority Row” and “Cry Wolf,” anyone?).</p><h3>2. Rhys Matthews</h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span><br>How could the Jason DiLaurentis look-alike not be considered a prime “A” suspect? Rhys (Caleb Lane) eerily shows up just after the girls are rescued from their underground prison and awards Hanna a scholarship from the seedy Carissimi Group — guilty conscience, perhaps? Since we haven’t heard of him until now, it’s possible that he had the opportunity to play the role of “A” this entire time. The only evidence of innocence in his favor is that he was just now introduced, and that seems like a bit of a cop-out from the show’s creators.</p><h3>3. Sara Harvey</h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span><br>If Charles is so obsessed with his sister Ali and her friends, why was he hiding some other random girl in his underground dungeon? Sara (Dre Davis) has got the girls eating right out of the palm of her hand, and it’s oddly suspicious how quickly she forged a relationship with Emily. Charles disguising himself as a girl would be the ultimate plot twist, and not that surprising coming from a station that has been known to be ahead of the curve in terms of social issues. But as likely as it is that ABC Family would give “Pretty Little Liars” a transgender character, it’s unlikely that they would make that person the show’s ultimate villain. Too soon.</p><h3>4. Andrew Campbell</h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span><br>The blond beauty was already suspected to be “A” once, and claims the reason he disappeared while the girls were kidnapped was that he was busy looking for them to save his crush, Aria (likely story). But Andrew (Brandon W. Jones) looks oddly similar to Jason DiLaurentis, and has a documented obsession with the girls, with the doodles all over his notebook planning their downfall. We’re not ready to count him out.</p><h3>5. Noel Kahn</h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span><br>Noel (Brant Daugherty) has been creepy since the get-go. He always managed to show up at the right place at the wrong time, and was proven responsible for many of the crimes against the girls during his time protecting Alison while she was in hiding. They’ve thought he was trustworthy since, but what if he was the one who took the game from Mona at the end of Season 2? It’s doubtful, since he doesn’t look like a DiLaurentis and since he has a family who would definitely notice if he were an escaped mental patient and not their teenage son.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfnZ7j3FmamhfrLWwedOhnGaglaG5brXSZphmp55ivbOx062wZqSZqcGtsYyloJqqo2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-hollywood-starlets-who-actually-went-bald.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Hollywood Starlets Who Actually Went Bald">&larr;
