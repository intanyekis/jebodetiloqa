Having gotten her start as a weather forecaster for a small news station, she then went on to work in the press office of the White House for several years.</p><p>At this point in her career, Sawyer devoted a great deal of time as a literary aide while helping Richard Nixon write his memoirs, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, which was released in 1978.</p><p>Sawyer went on to be a general news and political correspondent for CBS News and followed that up by being the first female correspondent on 60 Minutes.</p><p>After a few years, she moved over to the ABC network. While there, she served as a co-anchor on the show Primetime, which later became 20/20.

He also serves as a co-anchor of the network's show 20/20.</p><p>Muir had a similar start to journalism as Sawyer, having gotten his start at a small news station as well. He later went on to join ABC News and worked his way up to the ABC World News sound stage.</p><p>Although <a href=#>David Muir works hard to keep certain aspects of his personal life under wraps</a>, it's not as easy to keep your earnings a secret when you are in the entertainment industry. While ABC has not formally released his salary, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Magazine speculates that the anchor earns between 5 and 7 million</a> per year for his journalism work on both ABC World News and 20/20. The publication estimates his net worth to be around 20 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When comparing Sawyer and Muir's net worth, it's obvious that Diane's sits much higher than David's. However, it's imperative to look at the span of their careers. David Muir was born in 1973, which is when Diane Sawyer was serving in the press office at the White House.</p><p>Therefore, she has several more years under her belt in the journalism realm. It's likely that as time progresses, David Muir will find himself at a similar net worth level as his predecessor, the esteemed Diane Sawyer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopmemnq0rdaynKtlnprBbsPOq6uhZaaav7TB0mabmq6ZmXquwcirZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nba-youngboy-lil-durk-india-royale-beef.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NBA YoungBoy Spars With Lil Durks Ex After Mocking Relationship">&larr;
