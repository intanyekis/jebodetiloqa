She came out as being transgender and completely transformed her life, all of which happened while the reality TV cameras were still rolling. Caitlyn's long-term commitment to appearing on Keeping Up With The Kardashians was instrumental in increasing her wealth status.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> She also went on to star in&nbsp;&nbsp;her own reality series</a> called I Am Cait, and appeared in I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! in 2003, and a number of other shows and appearances soon followed.

She has built an empire for her family, and is now worth $170 million as a result of her efforts.</p><h2 id=gordon-ramsey-220-million>Gordon Ramsey: $220 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gordon Ramsay has been on more reality television shows than fans can count. In his earlier days, prior to reaching fame, he appeared on Boiling Point and Beyond Boiling Point, as well as a show called "Faking It."&nbsp; He broke out to star in his very own reality series with Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares in 2004, and fans instantly gravitated to the program. Hell's Kitchen, Ramsay's Best Restaurants, Hotel Hell, and 24 Hours To Hell and Back soon followed. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His reality TV success</a>, paired with his successful restaurant ventures have led Ramsay to an astonishing $220 million net worth.</p><h2 id=jamie-oliver-300-million>Jamie Oliver: $300 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keeping with the theme of cooking-based reality TV shows, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie Oliver has earned a jaw-dropping $300 million fortune</a> by being featured in this genre.

As an heiress to the legendary Hilton fortune, she grew up in the lap of luxury. In spite of the wealth achieved by birthright, she has shockingly earned most of her own $300 million fortune all by herself. She first dabbled with reality television when she released The Simple Life, which co-starred her friends Nicole Ritchie and Kim Kardashian - who was not known to the world at that time. She has since gone on to grow her brand by selling a multitude of items that bear her name, and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> has recently gotten married in front of the cameras</a> with the release of yet another reality tv series called Paris In Love.</p><h2 id=ryan-seacrest-450-million>Ryan Seacrest: $450 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryan Seacrest is quite possibly one of the hardest working celebrities in Hollywood.

He first appeared as a judge on Pop Idol in the United Kingdom, then lent his superstardom to the American Idol stage. He was the genius behind the creation of The X Factor as well as Britain's Got Talent and of course, that led to the wildly successful America's Got Talent reality television series. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He's deeply connected in the world of music</a> and his time on reality television has helped him achieve a solid net worth of $600 million.</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner-1-billion>Kylie Jenner: $1 Billion</h2><p>Kylie Jenner was the first of the Kardashian/Jenner clan to successfully be recognized with billionaire status.
