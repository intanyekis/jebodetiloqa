When you wake up, grab that cup of coffee and turn on the television, only a few shows grab viewers' attention, and one show has been doing just that for 32 years, and that is "Live! With Regis & Kathie", turn Regis & Kelly, turn&nbsp;Kelly & Michael, and finally Kelly & Ryan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the successful morning show has seen a turnover of three different hosts since first airing in 1988, it has remained one of the most popular morning shows ever since it first debuted on TV, and rightfully so!&nbsp;The show was hosted by Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee before introducing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Ripa</a> after Kathie's departure.</p><p>Regis and Kelly took over the show for 10 years before former football player <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Strahan</a> would step in and replace Regis Philbin. Despite the show's continued success, "Live! With Kelly & Michael" would soon erupt into a sea of tabloid rumours, magazine headlines and a feud that has continued well into 2020. Here is the true story about what happened between Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=live-with-regis-amp-kathie-lee-began-in-1988><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>"Live! With Regis & Kathie Lee" Began In 1988</span></h2><p>Before Kelly Ripa was sitting beside Michael Strahan on 'Live!' it was all about Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford. The two first began the ABC morning show way back in 1988 and did a stellar job at being one of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York City's</a> most-watched show in history for 12 years. The world would wake up to Regis and Kathy, but that changed in the early 2000s.</p><h2 id=in-2001-kelly-ripa-replaced-kathie-lee><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>In 2001, Kelly Ripa Replaced Kathie Lee</span></h2><p>After it was announced that Kathie Lee Gifford would be leaving 'Live! With Regis & Kathy", the production company immediately started looking for a replacement host, and after a number of auditions, Kelly Ripa landed the part! As of 2001, the show was officially renamed to "Live! With Regis & Kelly", where fans immediately fell in the love with the then soap opera actress.</p><h2 id=regis-philbin-officially-announced-his-departure-in-2011><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Regis Philbin Officially Announced His Departure In 2011</span></h2><p>Although "Live! With Regis & Kelly" was a massive success, the network and fans of the show were shocked when it was announced that the leading man himself, Regis Philbin, would be officially leaving the show. Regis had a whopping 23-year career on the hit morning show, so his departure definitely affected many of the viewers, and Kelly Ripa herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Is What Kelly Ripa Looks Like Without Makeup</a></span></p><h2 id=football-player-michael-strahan-was-then-considered><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Football Player Michael Strahan Was Then Considered</span></h2><p>Much like after Kathie Lee Gifford's departure, it was time to find a replacement host for Regis Philbin. While Kelly Ripa could have easily handled the show herself, it was tradition to always have two hosts, so the hunt began. After months of searching, former football player Michael Strahan was considered for the part, but of course, Kelly Ripa needed to give her stamp of approval.</p><h2 id=live-with-kelly-amp-michael-was-given-the-green-light><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>"Live! With Kelly & Michael" Was Given The Green Light</span></h2><p>After going back and forth on negotiations, different hosts, and Kelly's very important opinion, ABC officially agreed to sign on Michael Strahan as the official co-host. It did not take too much for both Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan to develop quite the budding friendship, one that worked brilliantly on-screen. Fans were beyond happy with Strahan, and ratings were as great as always.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-two-were-on-air-for-5-years><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Two Were On-Air For 5 Years</span></h2><p>Michael Strahan took on the role of co-host better than anyone we have seen! Many people doubted his abilities to run a talk show considering he had only worked in the world of sports prior to landing the gig, but much to our surprise, Strahan picked things up faster than you could think and did so for his entire five-year stint on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Facts About Kelly Ripa & Michael Strahan That Have Recently Surfaced</a></span></p><h2 id=things-began-to-take-a-turn-for-the-worse><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Things Began To Take A Turn For The Worse</span></h2><p>Despite Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan appearing to get along on-screen, it seems as if the two were having some troubles of their own. Many sources claimed that Kelly and Michael were butting heads quite a bit off the air and that it was starting to affect the workplace. Considering Kelly had been on the show for 10 years, she felt as if it was her show, and that's not something Strahan felt he could deal with any longer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-strahan-officially-announced-he-d-be-leaving-the-show><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Michael Strahan Officially Announced He'd Be Leaving The Show</span></h2><p>With everything that had gone down, Michael Strahan revealed that he too would be leaving the show, and stepping down from co-hosting "Live!". Although this was a sad goodbye, Strahan would not be leaving our televisions screens for good, but simply moving to "Good Morning America", but things definitely did not go down without a fight.</p><h2 id=strahan-left-3-months-earlier-without-kelly-knowing><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Strahan Left 3 Months Earlier Without Kelly Knowing</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>4 </span><span></span></h2><p>Despite being happy for his success, Kelly Ripa would soon be caught totally off guard with Michael's decision to leave the show<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> three months before he was expected to</a>. This early departure was never communicated to Kelly, having her find out when she showed up to work on the day of. Ripa was completely blindsided by Michael Strahan's early departure, and it was clear she was not happy about being the last to know.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Kelly Ripa Is Friends With (10 Who She Avoids At All Costs)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-ripa-took-a-week-off-from-the-show><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kelly Ripa Took A Week Off From The Show</span></h2><p>After being filled in on Michael Strahan's decision to leave the show ahead of schedule, without even mentioning anything to Kelly Ripa, the host, who had spent nearly 15 years on "Live!" felt completely betrayed by both Strahan and ABC, leading her to take that week off. Fans were confused with what was happening, and if "Live!" would be back, however, Kelly soon returned to the show, with an opening monologue that definitely had us feeling for her.</p><h2 id=the-two-are-no-longer-on-speaking-terms><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Two Are No Longer On Speaking Terms</span></h2><p>After leaving the show ahead of time, and not mentioning it to Kelly Ripa, Michael Strahan joined the "GMA" team and fit in immediately. Although both Kelly and Michael spent five years together, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two are no longer speaking, says Strahan</a>. After being blindsided and betrayed, we certainly do not blame her for harbouring any hard feelings, that's for sure!</p><h2 id=ryan-seacrest-took-over-strahan-s-spot><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ryan Seacrest Took Over Strahan's Spot</span></h2><p>While the drama between Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan was splashed on every possible magazine cover, news outlet and gossip site online, things finally died down, and it was time to find another permanent co-host on "Live!". After a few weeks of searching, it was revealed that Ryan Seacrest would be the newest addition to show, and one that would fit like a glove. The two have been co-hosting together since 2016, and have been doing so very effortlessly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Ripa Struggles With Fashion As Ryan Seacrest Gets Charitable</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqScrnqztc%2BaZJqmlGK6qq%2FHmpylZaOpv6K0wKeqZpufor2ttcKaq56cXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW6x16mjmqGemrFuuMivnGavmam1brfEpaOyZZGjsW65yJyfmp2cYr%2B6rc1o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nick-carter-breaks-silence-after-brother-aaron-carters-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nick Carter Breaks Silence After Brother Aaron Carter's Death">&larr;
