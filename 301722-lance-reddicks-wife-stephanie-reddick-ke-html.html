She prefers to keep away from the spotlight despite occasionally appearing to support her movie star husband at Hollywood events.</p><p class=dh>Lance Reddick, who plays Charon in "John Wick," became a married man for the second time in 2011 when he wed Stephanie Reddick, whom he met more than a decade before they exchanged vows. The actor considers his relationship with Stephanie as a union that would have been illegal when he was a child.</p><p class=dh>Stephanie is a private individual who does not have a strong media presence. She is pro-human and supports groups of society living with challenges, such as the LGBTQ+ community. She does not hesitate to attend significant events to clap for her famous husband in person.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0a056a3bb2b7f08f4dd55aa4c5588b40.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Lance and Stephanie Reddick at the "John Wick: Chapter 2" premiere at ArcLight Hollywood in Hollywood, California, on January 30, 2017. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Stephanie Is an Activist & Helps Raise Awareness in Saving Lives of the LGBTQ Community</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Stephanie lives a very private life, without many publicly shared opinions on tense societal topics. Still, she does try to support the disadvantaged groups in society. Her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/stephaniereddick/>Instagram account</a> is private, yet the only information available to users without access to her profile is an LGBTQ Suicide Prevention Lifeline <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://988lifeline.org/help-yourself/lgbtq/>link on her bio</a>.</p><p class=dh>The link opens up to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline website, giving those struggling with mental health a direct source of help. The website advises the LGBTQ+ community to acknowledge that they are not alone, talk to someone about their thoughts, build a support network, and devise a safety plan.</p><p class=dh>The website also announced that '988' has been the designated dialing code for the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline since July 16, 2022. In keeping with her support for the voiceless, Stephanie contributed to the #MeToo movement on Twitter. She wrote about how <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://twitter.com/steph_reddick/status/929081551291166720?s=20">she was also violated</a> by previously accused Robert Knepper in 1989.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/dd42a2ab6b755989a4946b8942711756.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Stephanie Reddick and Lance Reddick at the Pre-Emmy Party at Sunset Tower Hotel in Los Angeles, California, on September 20, 2019. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Lance Reddick's Wife Planned Their Wedding Herself after Years of Dating</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Stephanie tied the knot with her actor husband in June 2011 after 12 years in a committed relationship. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://mspmag.com/weddings/stephanie-lance-keeping-it-simple/>The wedding</a> was put together by Lance's wife, who knew very little about the color of the decor flowers until the actual wedding day. She had two priorities; that guests should have fun, and Lance not seeing her dress before the wedding.</p><p class=dh>Stephanie met her husband in 1999 when she worked at the Guthrie Theater in her home stateâ€”Minnesota. Considering that Stephanie is from Minnesota and they met there, the California-based couple had their wedding in Minneapolis' stunning Bar Lucrat. They were catered with sumptuous meals, with consideration for gluten-allergic guests.</p><p class=dh>Stephanie praised the Bar Lucrat staff for adjusting to ensure she had the perfect day. "The staff changed everything around so I could walk down the stairs in the mezzanine," the chuffed bride <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://mspmag.com/weddings/stephanie-lance-keeping-it-simple/>said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c833decfcc07692a32d0c7f047b11f93.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Lance Reddick and Stephanie Reddick at the 22nd Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation's Oscar Viewing Party in Los Angeles, California, on March 2, 2014. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>After all the somewhat low-key planning, the couple looked good on their big day. Stepanie's husband wore a charcoal grey suit with a tie and flowers for decoration. Stephanie wore a simple dress that she had bought online. She concluded her description of the wedding with the story behind her dress, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://mspmag.com/weddings/stephanie-lance-keeping-it-simple/>saying</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I found it online for $250, including shipping. Lance picked it up at the post office, and it fit perfectly. My favorite moment of the wedding day was when my mom saw me in my dress, and she started crying."</p><p class=dh>Stephanie's husband took to Twitter to air an accurate yet controversial opinion. He mentioned that an interracial marriage like theirs <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://twitter.com/lancereddick/status/1442230533694504963?s=20">would have been illegal</a> when he was born. The actor also touched on how recent events reflect how far people have to go to initiate change.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/098ca5266fe10890d2bbbc983aaafc3f.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Lance and Stephanie Reddick at a screening of "Bosch" held at The Dome at Arclight Hollywood in Hollywood, California, on February 3, 2015. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Stephanie Reddick Has Had Red Carpet Event Appearances to Support Her Husband</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Stephanie holds the details of her private life close to her chest and rarely makes enough noise to attract media attention. However, she does not let her lifestyle choice hold her back from showing support for her husband. She attended various prestigious Hollywood events with him.</p><p class=dh>On February 27, 2013, Stephanie was attached to her husband by the hip at the "Phantom" premiere in Hollywood. Later that year, she attended the New York premiere of "White House Down" with her famous husband. The event was to promote the movie starring her husband and ZoÃ« <a class="me a" href=#>Kravitz's once-alleged boyfriend</a>, Channing Tatum.</p><p class=dh>She made another appearance on October 22, 2014, supporting Lance at the premiere of the highly anticipated blockbuster "John Wick" starring the <a class="me a" href=#>ever-humble Keanu Reeves</a>. The event was held at the Arclight Hollywood and was attended by many revered actors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/72eb576c5e9beec448d62a61a235e0b2.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Lance and Stephanie Reddick at the FOX All-Star Party in West Hollywood, California, on July 23, 2012. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Her husband also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CNseIgursAQ/>shared a photo</a> of them with Kunal Nayyar, married to former Miss India <a class="me a" href=#>Neha Kapur</a>. They met the "Big Bang Theory" star at a Comic Con event in San Diego 12 years ago.</p><p class=dh>Although Stephanie's Instagram account is private and does not reveal much about her personal life, she has a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/steph_reddick>Twitter account</a> that is open to the public. However, her Twitter bio <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/steph_reddick>says</a>, "I don't tweet often; I'm usually out living my life," summarizing the actor's wife's media presence.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Stephanie & Lance Often Go on Dates and Overseas Trips</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Stephanie and her husband love a good vacation and often take those breaks. In 2021, they traveled from the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CWdzU7BLnug/>west to the east</a> for "quality family time." They also spent <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B5aa25RJ1SS/>Thanksgiving 2019 together</a>, and Lance captioned a photo of them wishing to find "all the reasons to give thanks."</p><p class=dh>Their travels are not limited to the borders of North America Stephanie and Lance have taken trips to Europe as well, firstly <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bzl3ntVp5Iw/>traveling to Serbia</a> in July 2019â€”presumably for work and leisure as the caption suggestsâ€”and ending the year with a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B5L6jU1JYcj/>trip to London</a>, where they visited the London Eye. Lance enjoys jet-setting with his "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B2ceEw9Jrbr/>favorite date</a>."</p><p class=dh>There are no public records of any children between Stephanie and her husband, although he has revealed that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://twitter.com/lancereddick/status/1483556302068625410?s=46&t=MCLEUkAu_owL-n4eXL3pzQ">he is a grandfather</a>. The "John Wick" star has a daughter from a previous relationship who he considers one of the greatest mothers ever, per an Instagram post on <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/COqcKyApBKV/>Mother's Day 2021</a>.</p><p class=dh>The actor once shared how his dreams of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.vestalmag.com/lance-reddick>becoming a rock star</a> inspired him to drop out of school to pursue a music career. He married his first wife soon after and became a father by age 26. After his music dreams fell apart, he moved to Connecticut to study at Yale.</p><p class=dh>The actor's decision to study film was the tipping point in his life, as that is what attributed to all the success he sees today. Although he is now in his second attempt at marriage, and his daughter is all grown up with a family of her own, he does not hold back from <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFlOYqVpadT/>showing public appreciation</a> for his baby girl.</p><p class=dh><i class=ch>If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), text "help" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741, or go to suicidepreventionlifeline.org.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmxnam9iZ3qtrc2cnGaqlZmxqq%2FKrGSwoZaaerTAxKmfmqaZmnqzscOdoJyjXaCyb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mitch-lightfoot.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mitch Lightfoot">&larr;
