Jackson.</p><p class=dh>Samuel L. Jackson shared an Instagram picture in honor of his daughter, Zoe. The actor expressed his admiration for his daughter in a few words.</p><p class=dh>While Jackson is one of Hollywood's most iconic actors, he has adopted the rule of keeping his family life private most of the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/27b20ddafb4c45bfb23687eeec3e560a.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Samuel L. Jackson with his wife LaTanya Richardson at the Opening Night Gala during day one of the 13th annual Dubai International Film Festival held at the Madinat Jumeriah Complex on December 7, 2016. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>However, he makes a point to share some of his family moments on social media sometimes, too. In his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.instagram.com/p/CFkt_nSADTD/>tribute to his daughter</a>, he published some never-seen-before photos.</p><p class=dh>The two pictures showed father and daughter at various events as they made faces for the camera. Appreciating his daughter, Jackson <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFkt_nSADTD/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"HAPPY DAUGHTER'S DAY Zoe‼️‼️A constant source of joy & bursting pride & delicious gastronomic surprises.

If someday, it turns out that she can act as well, the world will know that she's just a chip off the old block.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Jackson had decided to go to rehab and get his life straight because of his family.</strong></h3><p class=dh>As stated earlier, Jackson has never been one to say much about his family. He and his wife, LaTanya Richardson, appear to love the quiet life.</p><p class=dh>However, he's also never been shy to speak about his wife and daughter's impact on him. Particularly striking was when he opened up about a struggle he had with drug addiction.</p><p class=dh>Per reports, Jackson <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.metro.news/samuel-l-jackson-daughter-saw-me-passed-out/1473269/>had decided to go to rehab</a> and get his life straight because of his family. The actor explained that his wife and child once found him passed out on their kitchen floor after getting overly drunk.</p><p class=dh>Once he came to and realized what had happened, he knew that it was time to change and be a better man so he committed to rehab. So far, it's helped him. Apart from keeping his career together, Jackson has also kept his family and loved ones together.</p><p class=dh>The actor and his wife even celebrated their 40th anniversary earlier this year. On the secret to their success, <a class="me a" href=#>Jackson</a> told reporters at the time that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://blackdoctor.org/samuel-l-jackson-wedding-anniversary/>they just love each other</a>.</p><p class=dh>He also credited their success to a mutual understanding and the fact that they love to spend time together despite hectic schedules.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtqaW5kZXq0rcyunKVlnGK3oq%2FKrKanZaOdrrOx0manoaekpMButMisZJudkarBb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tom-pernice-jr-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Pernice, Jr Net Worth">&larr;
