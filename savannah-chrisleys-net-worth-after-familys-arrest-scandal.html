On top of that, there have been Chrisley spin-offs. With so much Chrisley content aired on television, it certainly seems like <a href=#>the family's secrets</a> would have come out long ago.</p><p>Of course, as any fan will know by now, the truth about the Chrisley family finances wasn't what it seemed. That fact has <a href=#>forced Todd And Julie Chrisley to adapt to federal prison</a>. While Todd And Julie Chrisley's finances were a mess, some of their children could have cashed in on their TV fame. For example, Chrisley Knows Best may have made Savannah Chrisley rich.</p><h2 id=savannah-chrisley-39-s-net-worth-and-salary-on-chrisley-knows-best>Savannah Chrisley's Net Worth And Salary On Chrisley Knows Best</h2><p>Over the last few decades, reality TV shows have taken the entertainment industry by storm. That fact has allowed several reality TV stars to become extremely rich thanks in large part to the networks paying them a fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kris-jenner-khloe-kardashian-true-thompson-and-kim-kardashian-at-the-season-2-premiere-of-the-kardashians-on-hulu-2022.jpg><p>Of course, it is no secret that members of the Kardashian-Jenner family have made a fortune from reality TV. Some other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highly-paid reality stars</a> include Lisa Vanderpump, Bethenny Frankel, as well as Jonathan and Drew Scott.</p><p>Similar to all those people, Savannah Chrisley has starred in a reality TV show for years. Reality shows like Chrisley Knows Best depend on scandals and tragedy to get ratings. That means Savannah Chrisley has benefited financially from the drama surrounding her famous reality TV family.</p><p>Unfortunately for Chrisley, however, she has never become nearly as famous as people like the Kardashians and Jenners. With that in mind, it is questionable if Chrisley's net worth has really benefited from her family drama or if the money she made is gone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Abby Lee Miller's Relationship With Todd Chrisley Before He Went To Prison</a></span></p><p>Back when the first season of Chrisley Knows Best was being filmed, Savannah Chrisley was only fifteen years old. Given how young she was at the time, Chrisley was still in school when she was introduced to the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/has-savannah-chrisley-s-net-worth-benefited-from-her-family-s-numerous-scandals-and-tragedies.jpg><p>On top of being crowned Miss Tennessee Teen USA, Chrisley went off to college. After initially attending Lipscomb University in Nashville, Chrisley wound up studying music at Belmont University. Chrisley also wound up attaining her real estate license.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Chrisley hasn't been busy attending school, she has found the time to launch businesses. In 2017, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrisley launched a clothing line</a>, Faith Over Fear, which she would eventually promote on the Home Shopping Network. However, Chrisley's clothing line never seemed to take off the way she hoped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/savannah-1-1.jpg><p>More recently, Chrisley launched a makeup line that still is operating today, Sassy by Savannah. On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the company's website</a>, Chrisley's makeup brand is called, "A brand created by a modern woman for the good of all,".</p><p>From the outside looking in, there is no way to know how profitable Sassy by Savannah has been for Chrisley. However, there haven't been any articles about Sassy by Savannah becoming a mammoth success. For that reason, it seems safe to assume that Chrisley's makeup company is still in the building stages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for Chrisley, being a reality TV star definitely has been a reliable income source for years. Unsurprisingly, however, Chrisley has never publicly stated how much money she was paid to star in Chrisley Knows Best over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Did Todd And Julie Chrisley Get Away With Fraud While Flaunting Their Wealth On Reality TV?</a></span></p><p>According to Reality Tidbit which cited Reality Star Facts, Chrisley was paid $250,000 per year to star in Chrisley Knows Best. That said, neither of those websites is considered reputable enough to take their reporting at face value.</p><p>If that figure was accurate, that would mean Chrisley was paid roughly $10,000 per episode by the end of Chrisley Knows Best. While that hasn't been confirmed, that figure certainly seems credible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/savannah-chrisley-smiling-and-wearing-a-colorful-dress.jpg><p>According to US Weekly's reporting, some reality stars get paid a lot more than $10,000 per episode and some make a lot less. However, Us Weekly reports that some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reality stars who are at a comparable level get paid a similar amount</a>. A perfect example of that is Teen Mom's Chelsea Houska got paid $250,000 for a season.</p><p>Fortunately for Chrisley, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she is set to star in a new reality show</a> due to the fame she got from her family's drama. <a href=#>Chrisley has also been able to make money from a podcast</a> due to her family's scandals. However, the podcast reportedly isn't too profitable yet as her annual podcast income is only reported to be between $1,600 and $25,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to reports, all the money Chrisley has made off her family's drama has added up. As of the time of this writing, Celebrity Net Worth reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrisley has a fortune worth $500,000</a>.</p><h2 id=savannah-chrisley-wants-to-pay-her-parents-39-17-million-debt>Savannah Chrisley Wants To Pay Her Parents' $17 Million Debt</h2><p>Based on everything that has been reported about Savannah Chrisley's financial situation, she has made a decent living for years now. However, it also seems clear that it would be a massive overstatement to claim that Chrisley has become extremely rich.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does The Cast Of Celebrity Big Brother Earn More Than Houseguests Appearing On The Dramatic Original Big Brother Series?</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for Chrisley, it appears like it could be a big problem for her that she hasn't become rich. The reason for that is directly related to the trouble that Chrisley's parents have gotten themselves into.</p><p>After a 2022 trial, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Todd and Julie Chrisley were found guilty of fraud and tax evasion</a>. As a result, Todd Chrisley was ordered to serve twelve years behind bars and Julie Chrisley was sentenced to seven years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/todd-and-julie-chrisley-red-carpet.jpg><p>On top of their prison sentences, the Chrisley parents were also ordered to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pay back roughly $17 million</a>. With Todd and Julie Chrisley behind bars, they can't make the kind of money they would need to pay what they owe.</p><p>In 2023, the Chrisley parents' lawyer Jay Surgent spoke to Entertainment Tonight. During that discussion, Surgent revealed that Savannah Chrisley has pledged to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">personally pay the money her parents owe</a>. If Savannah Chrisley attempts to make good on that, her net worth and everything she makes for a long time in the future could be wiped out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmq6Ro7uitIycn6uho6Gyur%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jJqdrZ2iYrOiucilsKxlkae%2Fpr%2FTZqqcmZ6Zrq17</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-close-are-bryan-cranston-and-aaron-paul-in-real-life-friendship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Close Are Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston And Aaron Paul In Real Life?">&larr;
