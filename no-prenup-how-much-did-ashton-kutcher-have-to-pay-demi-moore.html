Following Demi's marriage to actor, Bruce Willis, she and Ashton met and became inseparable. The two officially married in 2005 and were all anyone could talk about. While the wedding was well worth talking about, it was Ashton and Demi's stark age difference that really caught everyone's attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Demi, who was 40 when she met a 25-year-old Ashton Kutcher, are 15 years apart. This led countless people to believe <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their marriage</a> wouldn't last, and while the two did, in fact, split in 2013, their age didn't seem to be a reason why. Although their split came as a shock, their settlement was an even bigger surprise! Here's how much Ashton had to dish out to Demi amidst their separation.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Where Does Demi Mooreâ€™s Relationship With Ashton Kutcher Stand Today?</a></span></p><h2 id=ashton-amp-demi-divorce-no-prenup>Ashton & Demi Divorce, No Prenup?</h2><p>Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore made headlines when it was revealed that the two had officially begun dating. Moore, who had just spent the last 13 years married to fellow Hollywood actor, Bruce Willis, found herself dating Ashton Kutcher back in 2003. The two had first met at a mutual friend's dinner party in New York City. Ashton was hosting 'Saturday Night Live' at the time, and Demi was in the Big Apple doing press for her comeback role in the film 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two are said to have hit it off instantly, and it appears the rest is history! In 2005, the duo was officially married. Although their status as celebrities had the world talking, it was their 15 year age difference that really caught everyone's attention. While age never played a role in splitting up, the two separated in 2011 after 6 years of marriage. Considering the two hadn't signed a prenup, this meant that Ashton Kutcher was expected to hand over 50% of any earnings and assets he made during his marriage to Demi.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Ashton Kutcher Remains Actively Involved In The Lives Of Demi Moore's Children</a></span></p><p>During Ashton and Demi's time together, Kutcher scored the role of a lifetime making millions on 'Two & A Half Men'. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashton was making a whopping $750,000 per episode</a>, and since Demi wasn't working as much as she was during the 90s, it was clear that Ashton was making the most. This ultimately led to quite the divorce battle, where Demi reportedly<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> demanded a whopping $24 million</a> from Ashton Kutcher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was a massive settlement and made the divorce process last quite a long time! In 2013, Ashton and Demi's divorce was finally finalized after a lengthy 2 years process. Although the exact figure of how much Ashton had to pay Demi remains private, reports claim that Demi walked away with quite a large sum, however, no spousal support as Kutcher refused to pay the outlandish number Demi requested.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Were Ashton Kutcher And Demi Moore's Relationship Like?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilqGWgp7Kvwc9mn6ivXaLCpLSMnaCdZZGotbW7zWairqyTnbKzecearZ5lpKR6sa3YZpuepZliurC70Z5m</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-traci-braxtons-husband-kevin-surrat-family-instagram-age-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Traci Braxtons Husband, Kevin Surrat?
