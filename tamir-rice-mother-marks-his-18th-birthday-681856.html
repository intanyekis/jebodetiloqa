The 12 year old was playing with a toy gun at a park across the street from his house when a 911 call was placed, resulting in two officers rushing to the scene. Officer&nbsp;Timothy Loehmann shot and killed Tamir within two minutes of arrival. Neither&nbsp; Loehmann or the other officer, Frank Garmback, were&nbsp; prosecuted to killing Tamir. Loehmann was eventually fired from the Cleveland Police Department for failing to disclose details about his job at the Independence Police Department where he was deemed emotionally unstable (the firing&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">decision was appealed</a> by a police union). In 2018, Loehmann was <a href=# rel=noopener>hired by another Ohio police department</a>&nbsp;but withdrew his application days later.</p><p>Rice, a mother of four and grandmother, recalled the moment that a group of neighborhood children knocked on her door and informed her that Tamir had been shot by police. She didn’t believe them at first, but once she&nbsp;got to the park, Rice saw her son lying on the ground. A group of officers stopped her from going near his body.</p><p>In the ambulance, Rice held onto her son’s hand but was told to stop touching him because his body was considered evidence. Tamir died the following day.</p><p>“People ask me all the time, ‘How are you holding up?’ I’m telling them I do know that it’s through the grace of God.”</p><p>Later in the interview, Rice revealed that the murders of Auhmad Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, all at the hands of white men — some of whom were police officers — took her to a “dark place.” In response to recent protests against racism and police brutality, Rice encouraged demonstrators to take the movement to legislators and the Supreme Court. “Those are the powers that be.”</p><p>When asked what her son could have become had he not been killed, Rice shared some of Tamir’s many talents. “He mastered all the sports that could be mastered. So [maybe he would have been] the next LeBron James, Odell Beckham..I really don’t know because he was robbed of that.”</p><p>Although the Rice family was awarded a $6 million judgment over Tamir’s murder, the city of Cleveland never admitted wrongdoing. In 2016, Rice founded the Tamir Rice Foundation in her son’s honor. The four-year-old organization champions police reform.</p><p>Rice also opened the Tamir Rice Afrocentric Cultural Center, which will house after-school programs focussed on tutoring, mentoring and arts, including music and dance.</p><p>“I am building a legacy,” said Rice. “To show people my strength and to show people I have not given up. I have to do this for him. I am his voice.”</p><p>See tributes to Tamir below.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">#BlackLivesMatter</a>: Wishing a Happy Birthday to Tamir Rice who would’ve turned 18 years old today if Cleveland Police didn’t kill him six years ago while he was playing in the park.
