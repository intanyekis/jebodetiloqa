As opposed to the rocky relationship between Brad and his oldest sons, Maddox and Pax, Shiloh appeared to have a great relationship with him.

Even after the pair's tumultuous divorce, Jolie ensured her children did not deviate from these values. However, the Jolie-Pitt kids appeared to take sides in their parents' feud over time. While Maddox and Pax's relations with Brad become strained, Shiloh's bond with him got stronger. She made headlines in March 2024 regarding <strong>her intentions to move out of Angelina's home once she turned 18</strong>. Shiloh had plans to live with Brad.
