Almost three months later, on April 4, the Wilmington Police Department confirmed that Johnson’s remains had been found on the banks of the Savannah River.&nbsp;</p><p>The authorities identified a suspect, 26-year-old William Haven Hicks, who was arrested in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and later extradited to North Carolina.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/William-Hicks.png><p>According to reports, Johnson and Hicks may have met through a dating app.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who was KC Lee Johnson? What happened to her?</h2><p>Johnson, who worked as a manager at a local Domino’s Pizza outlet, enjoyed anime and manga.&nbsp;</p><p>According to their partner, Bulla Brodzinski, Johnson was a kind and caring person who had helped them through a difficult time in their life.&nbsp;</p><p>Johnson allegedly told Brodzinski that they were going out and never returned.</p><p>Bulla further added that KC Lee Johnson had been a source of <a href=#>motivation</a> for him during a difficult period.&nbsp;</p><p>Johnson had helped him get back on track and make positive changes in their life. He expressed gratitude for Johnson’s support and noted that they had been able to open up to her during their conversations.</p><p>The Wilmington Police Department disclosed in a news release that Johnson was last sighted at the 1900 Block of Tradd Ct. Additionally, the department stated that Johnson had connected with Hicks on social media, potentially via a dating application.</p><p>The investigation involved multiple law enforcement agencies, including the Wilmington Police Department, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, and the Chatham County Police.&nbsp;</p><p>Hicks was charged with first-degree murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and kidnapping in connection to Johnson’s death.</p><p>Johnson’s sister, Amber Winnecoff, launched a GoFundMe fundraiser to raise funds to cover the victim’s funeral expenses. The fundraiser aimed to raise around $6,000, and over 80 contributors have already donated more than $5,000 to date.</p><p>The tragedy of Johnson’s untimely death brought attention to the ongoing violence and discrimination faced by the transgender community.&nbsp;</p><p>Advocates called for increased awareness and action to combat transphobia and promote equality and justice for all.</p><p>Johnson’s tragic death was the second known transgender American to die as a result of violence in 2023. The Human Rights Campaign acknowledged that the number of transgender deaths due to violence in the US could be higher, as some incidents go unreported or are misreported.</p><p>While the investigation into Johnson’s death continues, the Wilmington Police Department extended their condolences to Johnson’s family and friends during this difficult time. Hicks is currently in custody and awaiting trial.</p><p>Johnson’s death is a reminder of the importance of combating discrimination and promoting equality and justice for all individuals, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.&nbsp;</p><p>As advocates continue to push for change, we must work together to ensure that all members of our society are treated with dignity and respect.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC3wmajnp1dn7yputKopWarpKS%2Funs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./291830-boy-jaw-who-has-never-spoken-a-word-beco-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Boy without Jaw Who Has Never Spoken a Word Becomes a Famous Rapper">&larr;
