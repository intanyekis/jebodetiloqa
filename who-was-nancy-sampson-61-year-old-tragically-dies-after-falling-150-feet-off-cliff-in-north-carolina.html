She was sightseeing at the park at noon on September 23 when she tumbled over a cliff around the Glassmine Falls overlook.</p><p>Nancy is survived by her husband Robert Sampson, her two sisters, her brother, and her nieces and nephews. Speaking to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Guardian</a>, Robert said that she was a retired human resources director who worked part-time at an Ingles market in Greer.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>What is Kate Gosselin's net worth? Former 'Jon and Kate Plus 8' star 'borrowed' $100K from her children's trust fund 'to survive'</a></p><p>“She was eagerly waiting for me to retire,” he stated. “She had a huge heart and a glowing smile that everyone loved. My heart is broken ... I will miss her smile and kind heart.”</p><h2 class=split>When was Nancy Sampson discovered?</h2><p>On the day of the accident, National Park Service dispatch operators received a report of a female who had fallen down a steep cliff at Glassmine Falls Overlook at milepost 361 on the Blue Ridge Parkway at approximately 12.15 pm.</p><p>First responders from Reems Creek Fire Department recovered the body, with assistance from Mt Mitchell State Park Rangers and a Trauma Intervention Program of Western North Carolina volunteer.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Who was Austin Schwenk? Marine shot dead at Camp Lejeune barracks identified as North Carolina teenager</a></p><p>Rangers identified the body as Nancy Sampson and confirmed that the hiker was dead at the scene after succumbing to injuries from her fall.</p><p>The Reems Creek Fire Department posted photos of the recovery mission and stated crews rappelled over 100 feet down to locate the victim.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Who is Daniel Vines? North Carolina pastor's son, 2, shot in the head by 3-year-old sibling outside church</a></p><p>Additional details about the incident have not been released by the authorities.</p><p>National Park Service, however, informs that it is difficult to get a good view of Glassmine Falls from the overlook in question, partly because it is a “tall, skinny waterfall” across a valley. Visitors are told to bring a pair of binoculars if possible to maximize their chances.</p><h2 class=split>Hiking accidents in the summer of 2023</h2><p>Nancy Sampson's accident came in the wake of a series of tragic incidents during the summer, where multiple hikers around the world lost their lives in hazardous conditions such as high-altitude falls and extreme heat.</p><p>In August, a woman tragically died after a fall while hiking in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park. Just a few days earlier, three individuals lost their lives on the treacherous Aonach Eagach ridge in Glen Coe, Scotland, which is one of Britain's narrowest ridges.</p><p>In July, a porter met a similar fate when he fell during an ascent of K2, the world's second-highest mountain.</p><p>In June, a teenage boy perished after falling ill while hiking in scorching temperatures of 119F (48.3C) during a visit to Big Bend National Park in southwest Texas. Tragically, the boy's stepfather also lost his life in a car crash while desperately searching for help.</p><p>In yet another incident during the same month, a 71-year-old man died in Death Valley National Park, located between eastern California and Nevada. This is one of the hottest places on Earth, and temperatures had soared to at least 121F (49.4C) when the man succumbed to the extreme heat.</p><p>In contrast, back in August, a 13-year-old boy miraculously survived a 100ft fall from a ledge at the Grand Canyon. In an interview following his treatment for injuries, the teenager acknowledged that he had been “inches away from death.”</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Who is Noah Benjamin Bliss?
