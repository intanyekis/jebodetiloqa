He has made a $600 million fortune scouting for young talented artists through his shows that have become the biggest stars in the world. Along with having a good eye for people, he is also known to splash out extensive checks for automobiles and real estate. In 2014, after months of looking for an ideal apartment, he made a $10 million purchase buying a luxury condo in Manhattan, New York, before the arrival of his child <a href=#>with his girlfriend, Lauren Silverman</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A cozy yet lavish home for the family, Simon Cowell made a thoughtful purchase buying a home on one of the best and most reputed streets of New York. Let’s take a look inside the $10 million love nest shared by him and his girlfriend, Lauren Silverman.</p><h2 id=a-home-in-the-best-neighborhood>A Home In The Best Neighborhood</h2><p>Along with owning a property in Beverly Hills, Simon Cowell wanted to purchase a property in the most happening city of America. As Silverman hails from America and Cowell wanted to juggle his work and personal life in the USA and Britain, he decided to raise his child in New York. A practical purchase, the home is located close to where Silverman’s ex-husband Andrew and son Adam live together. Shelling out a hefty amount, the apartment is located on East 78th Street on the Upper East Side, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, known for the upscale brownstone buildings and designer boutiques of top fashion houses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside The Million-Dollar Fortune Of Keanu Reeves</a></span></p><p>A home with rich history, the East 78th Street apartments are a row of five attached brownstone houses on Manhattan street, out of the eleven original homes built in 1861 when the area was getting developed along with the inception of rail transit. Located between Third and Lexington Avenues, the apartment owned by Cowell is one of the most prestigious condos in Manhattan.</p><h2 id=an-ideal-spot-for-the-family-of-three>An Ideal Spot For The Family Of Three</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the home's most unique and stand-out features is the sculpted stairway that features frosted glass located on white risers. Additionally, the home has oak floors and smart-wired services for ease of use and safety. Two bedrooms, including the Master Bedroom, feature bathrooms and a walk-in closet. Like the shades of cream and beige in the bedroom, the bathroom follows a similar color scheme. The Master Bathroom has a rectangular bathtub and a marble double-vanity sink, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E Online</a>.</p><h2 id=secured-with-safety-and-security>Secured With Safety And Security</h2><p>For outdoors, the apartment features a private library terrace that can be accessed from the kitchen and corner living room, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>. There is ample outdoor space on the pad for couches and a small round dining table for an intimate dinner. The terrace also features plenty of shrubs to keep the surroundings fresh and airy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Built to keep the high-profile residents safe and sound, the building comes with many amenities, including an indoor pool and a fully-equipped gymnasium for the couple to work out and relax. A unique part of the building is a side exit door that keeps the paparazzi away from the celebrities so they can escape their homes without getting photographed by the media as they leave. Along with buying a New York apartment, Cowell also purchased a $10 million <a href=#>home in Beverly Hills</a> for Silverman so the couple can stay in both locations during his shoots. The LA house is located in an exclusive Trousdale estate away from the public, where the couple can have the privacy they want.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simon Cowell has been making big purchases for himself and his children in the last couple of years for a luxurious yet safe living. Since Cowell and Silverman’s son was born in 2014, the couple has divided their time between New York and LA. The home is built for Cowell to raise his family in the comfort of the three-bedroom home that provides optimum security to the residents. Cowell and Silverman have been recently engaged and temporarily moved to England as he begins auditions for Britain’s Got Talent.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Highest Grossing Aaron Eckhart Movies</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E Online</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS2r7%2FInZxmq5mivK95wqiunqScYq6vsIylmK6qlaN6tLXLr5yrpZGjwG59j2akoqScnryvecuorZ5lnprAtXs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mackenzie-ziegler.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mackenzie Ziegler, Biography, Age, Height, Songs, Dance Moms, and Net Worth">&larr;
