As a result of the world learning about his diagnosis, people have been <a href=#>looking back at Bruce’s past conduct in a new light</a>. On top of that, many people regret <a href=#>the harsh way they judged Bruce’s recent career choices</a>.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Kevin Smith Still Dislike Bruce Willis?</a></span>Of course, it should go without saying that Bruce Willis isn’t the only one whose life has been affected by his recent diagnosis. For proof of that fact, keep in mind that Bruce’s eldest daughter Rumer Willis is the one who announced her father’s diagnosis. With that in mind, there is renewed interest in Rumer’s life including how she amassed an impressive $4 million fortune according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-rumer-willis-rsquo-main-job>What Is Rumer Willis’ Main Job?</h2><p>As the eldest daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Morre, Rumer Willis has been around the acting business ever since she was a child. In fact, the same year that Willis turned seven years old, she made her big-screen debut in her mother’s film Now and Then. The following year, Rumer played a supporting role in another one of her mom’s films, Striptease, and that time she played the daughter of Demi’s character.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Are Bruce Willis And Demi Moore's Family Up To In 2021?</a></span></p><p>After continuing to appear in several of her mother and father’s films in supporting roles, Rumer Willis’ acting career changed in a big way in 2008. To the delight of many, Rumer played a major role in the popular comedy film The House Bunny which is a film that neither of her parents were a part of. In the years since that movie was released, fans remain interested in <a href=#>The House Bunny’s cast including how much money they all have now</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of Rumer Willis proving that she could succeed on her own merits, she went on to land roles in several TV shows. For example, on the television front, Rumer popped up in shows like Medium, CSI: NY, and Workaholics on top of landing recurring roles in the series 90210 and Empire. On top of that, Rumer appeared in several movies and she even landed a small role in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Of course, it should go without saying that landing a role in a Tarantino movie is a major deal for any actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of playing characters on the big and little screen, Rumer Willis allowed the world to know her a little better as a person in 2015. After all, that was the year that Rumer competed in the twentieth season of the hit “reality” competition show Dancing with the Stars. On top of winning new fans during her time competing in Dancing with the Stars, Rumer also managed to prevail and take home the much sought-after mirror ball trophy.</p><p>Once Rumer Willis proved that she can act and dance, most people assumed that they were aware of all her skills. As it turns out, however, Willis had yet another talent under her hat that most people were completely unaware of. After all, Rumer performed as the Lion during the first season of The Masked Singer and she survived until the eighth episode because it turned out that she has a fantastic singing voice. Given that Rumer was paid for all of her acting roles and her Dancing with the Stars and The Masked Singer tenures, she clearly has cashed in on her performing skills in a big way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-else-did-rumer-willis-amass-her-fortune>How Else Did Rumer Willis Amass Her Fortune?</h2><p>Based on all of the success that she has enjoyed in her entertainment career, it is clear that Rumer Willis should have been able to live off that alone. However, given the fact that Rumer has a very healthy net worth, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that there are other ways that she has added to her fortune over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Things Bruce Willis And Demi Moore Want To Keep On The DL About Their Daughters</a></span></p><p>One of the most notable ways that Rumer Willis has made money is that she has modeled in the past. For example, in 2011 the fashion label <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Badgley Mischka decided to revolve a marketing campaign around images of Rumer</a>. According to reports, Badgley Mischka’s marketing material featuring Rumer appeared in the pages of magazines like Vogue, InStyle, and Harper's Bazaar. On top of that, the images were also published online and in outdoor advertising.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When looking at Rumer Willis’ life closely, it is very clear that she has made a lot of money for herself. However, it would be silly to pretend that Rumer wasn’t given a lot of help from her rich and famous parents. On top of starting her acting career by appearing in her parents’ films, she became a lot richer because of her parents when she turned 25 because that is when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rumer gained access to her trust fund</a>. While it is unclear how much cash Rumer got from her trust fund, there is no doubt that it was a significant amount.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Demi Moore Reveals Who Her 'Women Crush Wednesday' Is In Her Recent Instagram Post</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq62Tmnq4tculoKxllJbCqLTTnqlmqqWisrN5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpeZFpaWtn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./michelle-trachtenberg-claps-back-at-trolls-saying-she-looks-sick.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michelle Trachtenberg Claps Back at Trolls Saying She Looks Sick">&larr;
