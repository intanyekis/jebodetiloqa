Some women prefer a guy who is stable in his career and has aspirations to be a leader in his field, and they really don’t focus too much on how the guy looks. Other women prefer a guy who is popular for his looks, just so they can make all their friends jealous by showing up with the guy to parties and social events. And there are some women who want the looks, money and fame all rolled into one attractive man, which is whey they prefer to date athletes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Professional athletes have a reputation for being egotistical pretty boys who sleep with girls for, well, sport. Even many of the athletes who get married or stay in long-term relationships have been known to have several affairs during their careers. So, why do women keep falling for them? Maybe their charm is too alluring to resist. Maybe these women are sports fans and enjoy going to games and being photographed. Or, it could be because these star athletes are worth millions of dollars, and who wouldn’t want a piece of that action?&nbsp;Here are 12 gorgeous women who have dated the most athletes.</p><h2 id=jessica-simpson>12. Jessica Simpson</h2><p>These days, <a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a> is much more well-known for her successful fashion empire, which includes shoes and handbags, than she is for her music. The singer and sister of <a href=#>Ashlee Simpson</a> (who is now married to <a href=#>Diana Ross’</a> son Evan), has also been in the news due to her love for athletes. She dated football player <a href=#>Tony Romo</a> back in 2007, but the couple split two years later. Jessica then went on fall in love with former football player Eric Johnson. The two got engaged in 2010, have two children together and after a long engagement, finally tied the knot in 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=madonna>11. Madonna</h2><p>The reigning Queen of Pop has certainly had her share of interesting relationships. She was romantically linked to <a href=#>Dennis Rodman</a> back in the 1990s, when Rodman played for the San Antonio Spurs. Between the years of 2007 and 2009, <a href=#>Madonna</a> was rumored to be in a relationship with baseball player <a href=#>Alex Rodriguez</a>, although the two have never said they were anything more than friends (we find that hard to believe). Obviously, Rodriguez has a thing for blondes, since he has also dated <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a> and Kate Hudson. Madonna is allegedly dating one of her background dancers these days, since she split from her director husband <a href=#>Guy Rithcie</a> a few years ago.</p><p></p><h2 id=paris-hilton>10. Paris Hilton</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The hotel heiress has definitely had her share of “suitors.” There were a few times when her fans thought she was going to settle down, but <a href=#>Paris</a> is apparently still looking for her Prince Charming. Back in 2000, Hilton and retired boxer <a href=#>Oscar de la Hoya</a> were an item. She has been romantically linked to <a href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo</a> (who also dated Kim Kardashian briefly), and was also previously in a relationship with hockey player Jose Theodore. Hilton also had a “thing” with hot tennis player <a href=#>Andy Roddick</a>, who went on to date <a href=#>Mandy Moore</a> long-term, but ended up marrying model and actress <a href=#>Brooklyn Decker</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=pamela-anderson>9. Pamela Anderson</h2><p>Even though former <i>Baywatch</i> babe will likely always be linked to ex-husband rocker <a href=#>Tommy Lee</a>, whom she has two sons with and considers family, <a href=#>Anderson</a> has also had her share of romantic connections with athletes. In the 1990s, she and former pro surfer Kelly Slater were an item. Retired racecar driver <a href=#>Eddie Irvine</a> also stole Pam’s heart for a while. From 2007 to 2008, Anderson was romantically linked to football player David Binn, who was playing for the San Diego Chargers at the time. Pamela took a break from athletes for a while, and decided to enter into a disastrous whirlwind of a marriage with <a href=#>Kid Rock</a>. She also married <a href=#>Rick Salomon</a>, separated from him, and married him again. Maybe Anderson should stick to athletes when she’s ready to date again. After all, she was definitely in the tabloids less when she had a pro baller on her arm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=tara-reid>8. Tara Reid</h2><p>Between the years of 2002 and 2005, actress <a href=#>Tara Reid</a> had a different athlete as a boyfriend, at least once a year. This is likely part of the reason she got a reputation for being a party girl. That, and her drunken, wardrobe malfunction episodes. In 2002, she was linked to football star <a href=#>Tom Brady</a> and dated former New York Giants tight end Jeremy Shockey the following year. In 2004, she was retired NFL quarterback Kyle Boller’s girlfriend. The same year, she dated <a href=#>Sergei Federov</a>, who is known as a legend in the NHL, but the relationship was short-lived. From 2004 to 2005, she was in a relationship with Mark Phillippoussis, a tennis player from Australia. From 2013 to 2014, Reid shared on Twitter that she was in a relationship with Erez Eisen, a musician from Israel. Guess she decided to give the athletes a break for a while.</p><p></p><h2 id=elisha-cuthbert>7. Elisha Cuthbert</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Canadian actress clearly has a thing for guys who play winter sports. She was just 17 when she moved to the U.S. from Canada to pursue an acting career, and appeared in shows such as <i>24, Happy Endings</i> and <i>One Big Happy</i>. She dated hockey player Sean Avery, and he obviously wasn’t over the break-up, because he got suspended for six games and booted off the Dallas Stars for making rude comments about <a href=#>Elisha</a> and her relationship with current husband <a href=#>Dion Phaneuf</a>, who is also a hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Elisha was also previously romantically linked to professional snowboarder Shaun White from 2005-2007.</p><p></p><h2 id=kate-hudson>6. Kate Hudson</h2><p>Actress <a href=#>Kate Hudson</a> is known for her personality almost as much as she is for her work. She is the daughter of actress <a href=#>Goldie Hawn</a>, and both women have a bubbly, friendly personality that some find alluring. It seems that Hudson has had a pretty profound effect on a few athletes over the years. She was in a relationship with baseball star Alex Rodriguez for a brief stint, but also had romantic ties to former professional cyclist <a href=#>Lance Armstrong</a>. We’re betting she’s glad she and Armstrong called it quits before his admission to using performance-enhancing drugs was revealed. Kate also had a relationship with golfer <a href=#>Adam Scott</a>, and is now reportedly dating <a href=#>Nick Jonas</a> (the youngest member of the former Jonas Brothers band).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=alyssa-milano>5. Alyssa Milano</h2><p>Former Who’s The Boss and Charmed star <a href=#>Alyssa Milano</a>, has recently been in the news for her support of breastfeeding and her commitment to giving the best nourishment to her children, even if that means breastfeeding in public. She has a son and daughter with husband Dave Bugliari, who is an agent for the Creative Artists Agency. The two have been married since 2009, but before that, Milano had her share of athlete boyfriends. Her first publicized relationship in the 1990s was with hockey player Mayne McBean. She also dated Carl Pavano, a former MLB player. In 2004, she kept up her love for baseball players by having a short relationship with <a href=#>Barry Zito</a>, and had a short romance with pitcher Brad Penny the following year.</p><p></p><h2 id=tyra-banks>4. Tyra Banks</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Retired supermodel and successful businesswoman <a href=#>Tyra Banks</a> has been romantically linked to a few athletes. There have even been rumors that she really has a thing for basketball players. From 2001 to 2004, Banks was in a relationship with basketball star <a href=#>Chris Webber</a>. She also dated former basketball star and Italian entrepreneur Giancarlo Maracchini from 2005 to 2006. Tyra also had a relationship with <a href=#>Mark Messier</a>, formerly of the New York Rangers, and is even rumored to have dated <a href=#>Tiger Woods</a> back in the day. Banks is currently dating Norwegian photographer Erik Asla, but she is rarely seen in public with him, because she doesn’t want to “jinx” it.</p><p></p><h2 id=serena-williams>3. Serena Williams</h2><p>This Champion tennis player likely has an affinity for athletes because she enjoys dating guys who can relate to her career-wise. In the early days of her career, she was in a relationship with former basketball player Corey Maggette. In 2003, she was romantically linked to retired NFL player Keyshawn Johnson. <a href=#>Serena</a> was also rumored to be in a relationship with basketball player <a href=#>Amar’e Stoudmire</a> in 2010 (Stoudmire also dated singer <a href=#>Ciara</a> previously). Most recently, Williams has allegedly been in a relationship with rapper <a href=#>Drake</a>, and also dated rapper <a href=#>Common</a> a few years back. Clearly, she likes musicians as well, but if things don’t work out with Drake, at least she knows there are some athletes who are definitely rooting for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=gabrielle-union>2. Gabrielle Union</h2><p>Actress <a href=#>Gabrielle Union</a> is a die-hard sports fan, and played basketball when she was younger. That likely has a lot to do with why she has a thing for athletes. Her NBA beau <a href=#>Dwayne Wade</a> proposed to her in 2013, and the two are now married. Gabrielle has even been known to interrupt her hubby’s post-game interviews to give him critiques about his athletic ability, much to the delight of the couple’s fans. Union was previously in a long-term relationship with athlete Chris Howard from 2001 to 2006, and dated Darren Sharper of the New Orleans Saints from 2006 to 2007.</p><p></p><h2 id=kim-kardashian>1. Kim Kardashian</h2><p>Even though she has millions of her own, <a href=#>Kim</a> has been known to date an athlete or two. She had a long-term relationship with football player <a href=#>Reggie Bush</a>, and was in the stands cheering him on when his team won the Super Bowl a few years ago. The two even talked marriage, but in the end, they weren’t able to make it work, and Reggie ended up marrying a woman who looks a lot like Kardashian. Kim then moved on to basketball player <a href=#>Kris Humphries</a>, and married him during a TV special, but we all know how that ended (72 days later). Kardashian is now married to <a href=#>Kanye West</a>, and the two have a daughter and son together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>bossip.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>dailymail.co.uk</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>imdb.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>bleacherreport.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqal2cvLOzxKisrGWnpLqmuoywn6iulWKxosDEnWStoJViurC%2F02aYraCcmsGmv44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./diddy-son-christian-combs-2023-vmas-performance-dedicated-kim-porter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diddy &amp;amp; Son Christian Combs Dedicate VMAs Performance To Kim Porter  Hollywood Life">&larr;
