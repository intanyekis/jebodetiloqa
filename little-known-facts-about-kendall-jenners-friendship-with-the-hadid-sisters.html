While the ladies have found incredible success in the modeling industry in the past seven years — one thing that many know about them is that they're also close friends in their private lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="A Timeline Of Nina Dobrev And Julianne Hough's Friendship" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Timeline Of Nina Dobrev And Julianne Hough's Friendship</a></span></p><p>Today, we're taking a look at some facts most people probably don't know about Kendall Jenner's friendship with the Hadid sisters. From who Kendall was friends with first to just how Kendall is related to the Hadid sisters — keep on scrolling to find out!</p><h2 id=kendall-became-close-friends-with-bella-hadid-in-high-school><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kendall Became Close Friends With Bella Hadid In High School</span></h2><p>Kicking the list off is the fact that Kendall Jenner was first friends with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Hadid</a>, and not with Gigi like many may have thought. Here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Kendall revealed</a>:</p><p>"Gigi and I just started getting close when we started modeling, but Bella and I were actually really good friends since high school, and hung out every day in high school before either of us started working. It’s just funny because a lot of people don't know that Bella and I have been friends for like five or six years."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-she-only-started-hanging-out-with-gigi-hadid-when-the-two-became-models><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>But She Only Started Hanging Out With Gigi Hadid When The Two Became Models</span></h2><p>So while Kendall and Bella were hanging out with each other for a while, according to what the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping Up with the Kardashians star</a> shared — it seems as if she only started bonding with Gigi once all three ladies started their modeling career. Considering that the three would usually get booked for the same shows, it doesn't come as a surprise that they started hanging out quite a lot backstage!</p><h2 id=even-though-kendall-and-gigi-were-both-born-in-the-same-year><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Even Though Kendall And Gigi Were Both Born In The Same Year</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Gigi Hadid was born on April 23, 1995, and Kendall Jenner was born on April 3, 1995, — it seems as if Kendall bonded with Gigi's younger sister first.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="The 10 Strangest Friendships From 'Real Housewives'" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 10 Strangest Friendships From 'Real Housewives'</a></span></p><p>Bella Hadid was born on October 9, 1996, but the one-year difference certainly didn't mean anything for the young stars. Either way, today all three ladies are super close!</p><h2 id=all-three-ladies-had-their-breakthrough-in-the-industry-around-the-same-time><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>All Three Ladies&nbsp;Had Their Breakthrough In The Industry Around The Same Time</span></h2><p>Because all three ladies are approximately the same age it definitely doesn't come as a surprise that all three had a breakthrough in the modeling industry around the same time back in 2014. The fact that they were also friends and hanging out in the same start circles certainly helped their fame as fans were drawn to the fact that these pretty ladies were hanging out with each other all the time!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-the-three-love-working-together><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>And The Three Love Working Together</span></h2><p>While it wasn't so uncommon for models in the 90s and early 2000s to have feuds with each other — Kendall, Gigi, and Bella's generation have certainly changed things. The three ladies have always been very vocal about how much they're enjoying working with each other because for them, spending time at work with one another means they get to hang out with one of their closest friends!</p><h2 id=but-they-would-never-let-work-get-in-the-way-of-their-friendship><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>But They Would Never Let Work Get In The Way Of Their Friendship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, at the end of the day, all three are famous models and a little competition between them certainly wouldn't be surprising. However, all three of them have stated how they would never let work get in between their friendship — and when asked about it here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Gigi Hadid answered</a>:</p><p>"If they want Kendall, they're not going to want someone who looks like me. It's completely different. I think friendships are a lot more valuable than one job. If you're going to let it ruin that, then that's stupid."</p><h2 id=their-mothers-kris-jenner-and-yolanda-hadid-are-reality-television-stars><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Their Mothers Kris Jenner And Yolanda Hadid Are Reality Television Stars</span></h2><p>Another thing the models certainly bonded over is the fact that both Gigi and Bella Hadid as well as Kendall Jenner have moms who are pretty famous reality television stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="A Timeline Of Taylor Swift And Karlie Kloss' Friendship" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Timeline Of Taylor Swift And Karlie Kloss' Friendship</a></span></p><p>Gigi and Bella's mother <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yolanda Hadid</a> was a main cast number of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills from 2012 until 2016, while Kendall's mom Kris Jenner shared her life on Keeping Up with the Kardashians since 2007.</p><h2 id=kendall-and-the-hadid-sisters-have-divorced-parents><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kendall And The Hadid Sisters Have Divorced Parents</span></h2><p>Science having famous reality television star moms the models also bonded over the fact that they're their parents got divorced. Yolanda Hadid divorced real estate developer Mohamed Hadid in 2000, while Kris Jenner divorced retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Caitlyn Jenner in 2015. Even though the divorces happened at different stages in their life, it's safe to say that the models can still relate to each other!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-three-models-have-become-major-fashion-trendsetters><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>All Three Models Have Become Major Fashion Trendsetters</span></h2><p>Another thing that Kendall, Bella, and Gigi certainly have in common is the fact that all three of them are major fashion trend setters. Of course, experimenting with fashion comes with being a part of the fashion industry — but there is no doubt that the three ladies always look incredibly stylish and whatever they were fans try to copy!</p><h2 id=and-lastly-the-models-are-sort-of-related-through-david-foster><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And Lastly, The Models Are Sort Of Related&nbsp;Through David Foster</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alright, bear with us — they're technically not related but they do have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a family connection</a> through Canadian musician David Foster. From 2011 until 2017 Gigi and Bella's mother Yolanda was married to David Foster who was previously married to Linda Thompson. Linda Thompson, on the other hand, is Caitlyn Jenner's ex-wife and the mother of Kendall's half-brothers Brandon and Brody Jenner.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Everything We Know About Kendall Jenner And Hailey Bieber's Friendship" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About Kendall Jenner And Hailey Bieber's Friendship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoqykobJut82orqdllpawtb%2BMmpmoraRiuKa6w5qjpWWamruvsdGsZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2FHoqdmr5mptW7Ax55koZmUnrFuv8isq56qo2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./grace-mckeaney.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Grace McKeaney">&larr;
