While fans wanted to know about <a href=#>Swift's ex-boyfriends</a>, they also care about her family. For example, fans wanted to know <a href=#>how Swift's parents separation affected her</a><strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> and about <a href=#>the pop star employing her brother</a>.</p><p>Even though <a href=#>Swift is always adding to her net worth</a>, fans became concerned about <strong>rumors of an abandoned mansion</strong> she reportedly bought for her parents.

Furthermore, many of Swift's fans believed that the abandoned mansion was bought by the pop star for her parents to live in.

According to that link, it appears that the mansion seen in the videos <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is located in Lowhill Township, Pennsylvania</a>.</p><p>Since Swift is so beloved, the media reports on everything they can find out about her. For example, the media has reported on <strong>the homes that Swift has bought for her family</strong> in the past.</p><p>None of those reports indicate that Swift bought a home in Pennsylvania.
