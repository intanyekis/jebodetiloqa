Delaware US Attorney David Weiss, whose office was accused by IRS investigators of thwarting the pursuit of<a href=#> leads implicating Joe Biden,</a> was elevated to be a special counsel on Aug. 11, expanding his investigative and charging powers.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Joe and Jill Biden step off Air Force One in Reno late Friday. <span class=credit>AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Steyer’s Lake Tahoe property<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;is estimated by</a>&nbsp;Redfin to be worth $18.1 million.

They’ve never paid,” the source said.</p><p>First lady Jill Biden extended her stay on Kiawah another five days after testing positive for COVID-19.</p><p>For Thanksgiving, the extended Biden family stayed for six days at the&nbsp;<a href=#>Nantucket Island compound of billionaire investor David Rubenstein</a>, co-founder of the Carlyle Group.</p><p>The White House and a spokesperson for Rubenstein didn’t respond to inquiries about whether the Bidens paid.</p><p>In late December and early January, the first couple, their daughter Ashley and grandkids Natalie and Hunter stayed seven days for free as “guests” at the&nbsp;<a href=#>beachfront St. Croix home</a>&nbsp;of businesspeople Bill and Connie Neville.</p><p>The arrangement turned heads because the home typically is a VRBO rental and because the Nevilles gained access just weeks earlier to Biden’s first state dinner honoring French President Emmanuel Macron, joining about 300 guests including many billionaires and political and cultural powerbrokers.</p><p>Biden did not disclose any of his free vacations as president as gifts on annual disclosure forms, drawing criticism from government ethics experts who said the willful failure to report could amount to a felony.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3FmanFfl7alsc2sZK%2BZk5bBqrvNZpitZZKeua21zqeYoqqVYsGwuYysq56xlafAbn2XpmSlmZuaerWtx6icZqWRo8Cqu81o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./officials-family-4-including-solider-found-dead-fort-stewart.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Family of 4, including soldier, found dead at Fort Stewart  WSOC TV">&larr;
