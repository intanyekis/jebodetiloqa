For <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>, keeping things quiet does not seem to be part of his game plan. He publicly attempted to woo <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> after they split up, even though she never seemed to reconsider their divorce proceedings. He threatened Kim's then-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a>, made massive grand gestures like delivering tons of roses to her home, and then badmouthed her before finally seeming to move on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Move on he did, and quite quickly, too. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Kanye's divorce was finalized in November 2022</a>, after over two years of rumors and rumblings. In January 2023, Ye was "married" to his new "wife" Bianca Censori, albeit not legally. The relationship has everyone confused, with Kim reportedly unhappy, and many also wonder whether Bianca Censori made the right decision in linking up with Ye.</p><h2 id=kanye-west-39-married-39-bianca-censori-right-after-splitting-from-kim-kardashian>Kanye West 'Married' Bianca Censori Right After Splitting From Kim Kardashian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kim-kardashian-s-outburst-forced-kanye-west-s-new-wife-to-quit-social-media-here-s-why-bianca-censori-prefers-to-keep-a-low-profile.jpg><p>Though Kanye was first rumored to be seeing Irina Shayk following his breakup with Kim, the rumors were never confirmed. He was also spotted with Candace Swanepoel, but that could have been nothing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Either way, it was only a matter of months between Kim's February 2021 divorce filing and Kanye stepping out with various women. By January 2023, he had only been legally divorced for less than three months, but was apparently in a rush to get "remarried."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why The Kardashian Family Is Confused About Kanye West's Marriage To Bianca Censori</a></span></p><p>To date, it appears the marriage between Bianca Censori and Kanye West is not legal, as the couple didn't file a marriage license. Yet they act like a married couple, with Bianca meeting Ye's kids, the two wearing gold bands on their fingers, and Ye writing a song for Censori.</p><h2 id=ye-seems-to-be-styling-his-39-wife-39-the-same-as-his-exes>Ye Seems To Be Styling His 'Wife' The Same As His Exes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-7.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans and critics watched with some discomfort as Kanye West stepped out with short-term love Julia Fox back in January 2022 and almost immediately overhauled her wardrobe. In a gushing interview, Julia talked about Ye delivering a suite full of clothing to her at a hotel.</p><p>At the same time he was dating Julia, and making a pretty big scene while doing so, Kanye continued to talk about Kim publicly and claim he wanted his wife and family back.</p><p>As fans may have anticipated, the Julia-Kanye romance was shortlived, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia later said she only dated Kanye</a> so people would have something to talk about—and to help deter Kanye from bugging Kim.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Julia Fox Destroy Her Movie Career After Her Controversial Romance With Kanye West?</a></span></p><p>That didn't explain why, during their brief two-month relationship, Kanye seemed to completely overhaul Julia's look, practically parading her around in oddly styled outfits. Many critics compared Kanye's treatment of Julia to the way he revamped Kim's style back in the day—and the trend didn't stop with Julia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after the two went public, Bianca cut off her long brown hair and dyed it blonde. It's possible that <a href=#>Bianca wanted to end comparisons between her and Kim</a>, but many are only seeing similarities in how Ye handled his ex's styling and how he has 'dressed' girlfriends since then.</p><p>It's widely assumed that Ye is behind Bianca's fashion transformation and new 'do.</p><h2 id=could-bianca-censori-be-a-good-influence-on-ye>Could Bianca Censori Be A Good Influence On Ye?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kanye-west-feels-new-wife-bianca-censori-truly-gets-him-after-she-takes-control-of-his-businesses.jpg><p>After the media circus surrounding Kanye West and his controversial moves, both in his personal life and with regard to his <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a>, Bianca Censori is said to be a supportive presence in his life. Already an employee of Yeezy, <a href=#>Bianca reportedly took control of Kanye's businesses</a> (despite their "marriage" not legally giving her access to any of it), which many—including Ye—think is a positive move.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Plans To Arrange A Private Meeting With Kanye West's New Wife, Bianca Censori</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Censori is also said to be close with Kanye and Kim's kids</a>, after photos of her holding North's hand went viral. Yet there are still concerns about the safety of those close to Ye, especially as former flame Julia Fox claimed that he was "delusional" and that she couldn't help him, despite wanting to.</p><p>Notably, Fox stated that she wanted to break up with Ye "the moment he started tweeting," but the rapper hasn't had social media for a while, between being banned from Twitter (and various other platforms over time) and deactivating his Instagram.</p><h2 id=is-bianca-and-kanye-39-s-quot-marriage-quot-healthy>Is Bianca And Kanye's "Marriage" Healthy?</h2><p>Why is Bianca Censori with Kanye West? Love is a possible answer, but because Censori is also closely tied to Ye's business dealings, it makes sense for fans to be worried about possible conflicts of interest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Censori, the publicity has already changed her life in negative ways, even if the business side is booming. <a href=#>Bianca is said to have quit social media</a> after Kim Kardashian let slip some uncomfortably specific quotes (which could be her judgment on Ye's remarriage) to her Instagram Stories.</p><p>Amid rumors that Kim hates Bianca, it's unclear whether there's really a feud going on, as neither party has specifically spoken out about it. Though it's likely a positive thing for Ye's reputation the less active he is on social media, that doesn't mean things are necessarily peachy behind the scenes.</p><p>Only time will tell how his "marriage" plays out—whether it ever becomes legal or not—and how Kim and the rest of the Kardashians feel about it all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsBursiapZyZXZiyr7%2FOq6Bmr5mptW63wKewnmWnmsC1ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jose-altuve-astros-injury-net-worth-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jose Altuve: Astros, Injury &amp;amp; Net Worth">&larr;
