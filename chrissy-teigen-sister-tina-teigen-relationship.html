The two seem to always go absolutely above and beyond to bring their relatives together— whether it be by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writing a family cookbook</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">building a preschool in their home</a>, or throwing a Christmas bash with an actor dressed as Santa Claus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is clear that&nbsp;the pair&nbsp;is willing to do anything for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their children Luna and Miles</a>, but Chrissy and John&nbsp;are not afraid to spread the love beyond their nuclear family. Chrissy’s mother Vilailuck “Pepper” Teigen has been known to frequent the couple’s home and constantly appears on Chrissy’s Instagram.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is What Perez Hilton Has To Say About Chrissy Teigen’s Baby Bump</a></span></p><h2 id=a-family-of-stars>A Family Of Stars</h2><p>Pepper’s recent rise to relative fame also shows that the Legend family is not worried about including the rest of their family into limelight. She co-stars with her daughter in the Quibi show Chrissy’s Court,&nbsp;and her&nbsp;own Instagram account <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">boasts 349 thousand followers</a> and counting. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to</a>&nbsp;People,&nbsp;Pepper is even publishing her own cookbook—with her daughter’s blessing, of course.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With what seems like the whole family in the spotlight, some fans may be surprised to hear that Chrissy has a lesser-known half-sister named Tina Teigen. Who is Tina? Why doesn’t she appear as often in Chrissy’s fame-filled world? Do the two sisters have a good relationship?</p><p>We have investigated Chrissy and Tina’s relationship and compiled some information to help fans understand what exactly goes on between the pair when the bright lights of celebrity are switched off. Here’s everything we know:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrissy Teigen Is Obsessed And Declares The Dress Of The Summer</a></span></p><h2 id=tina-avoids-the-spotlight>Tina Avoids The Spotlight</h2><p>While Pepper seems to relish the bit of attention- and the opportunities that come with it- Tina seems to prefer staying away from the shiny world of her younger sister and mother.</p><p>In fact, Tina does not even have her own Instagram account, or at least not one open to the public. Instead, the oldest Teigen sister runs <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a small profile with the handle @pasha_speaks</a>, where she shares shots of her daughter Pasha Grace. “Watch me grow,” reads the bio.</p><p>The profile, however, does more than reveal Tina’s quest for relative privacy—it also gives fans an insider’s perspective on how often she sees her sister.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Tina does not post a lot of pictures of herself with Chrissy, she does share a number of cousin shots. The pictures feature Pasha&nbsp;playing alongside Luna and Miles, spending quality family time together.</p><p>A recent post, shared on June 23, shows Luna and Pasha swinging barefoot on a swing&nbsp;set in a simple, garden venue. The girls seem content as they smile sweetly at the camera, clearly soaking up a classic childhood moment. If anybody doubted that the girls were bonding in their shared play time, one only needs to see the photos caption to see otherwise: “cousin time.”</p><p>Fame, it seems, can keep family members offline, but it cannot keep them apart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrissy Teigen’s Physical Check Up Advice Gets Rather Personal</a>&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=sisters-that-travel-together-stay-together>Sisters That Travel Together, Stay Together</h2><p>While Tina may not love the spotlight, she is certainly not about to shy away from any of the other perks of having a famous sister—especially when it comes to traveling.</p><p>Over the years, Pepper has posted pictures of her daughters to give fans a clue of some of the incredible trips that the dynamic sister duo has taken together.</p><p>For example, on December 2, 2017, Pepper posted a stylish shot of Chrissy and Tina together in a luxury jet on a “Pan Am Experience.” The women were posing in matching hats&nbsp;reminiscent of the fashion from the late fifties and early sixties, as they prepared to embark on the exclusive experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Things Other Stars Have Said About Chrissy Teigen (Good And Bad)</a></span></p><h2 id=sisters-who-party-together>Sisters Who Party Together</h2><p>Recently, the sisters have not gone on as many trips together — perhaps due to travel restrictions — but the pair has not stopped partying together.</p><p>On February 16, Pepper posted another shot of herself and her daughters as they prepared for an evening on the town. In contrast to Chrissy, who was sporting a bright pink feathered dress, Tina went for something more understated: a gray, wool coat.</p><p>Despite being deeply different when it comes to showing off for the cameras, the sisters seem to enjoy each other’s company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Refinery 29&nbsp;</a>reported, the Teigen women all enjoy cooking, drinking and otherwise relaxing together. The outlet even found that the trio can happily spent a quiet Saturday evening together, eating Thai food and watching a movie.</p><p>The sisters, it seems, get along so well that they don’t need to post a bunch of selfies together to prove it.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrissy Teigen’s Plagiarism Push-Back</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqMC6edOeoKCdnmLAqr%2FTnqlmrJmjrm7AxKKenqZdp7KtrdOipqermJ69cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./irv-gotti-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Irv Gotti Net Worth - KahawaTungu">&larr;
