Whether it's playing a <a href=#>lovable character in Harry Potter</a>, a sparkling vampire in Twilight, or the greatest detective for <a href=#>DC</a>, Robert Pattinson has shown himself to be a franchise powerhouse in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robert Pattinson's <a href=#>net worth has changed drastically</a> since becoming a star, and these days, he can afford anything he wants. Despite this, Pattinson scored himself a relatively modest home a while back.</p><p>The house is gorgeous, and we have the details on the star's home below!</p><h2 id=robert-pattinson-is-a-massive-star>Robert Pattinson Is A Massive Star</h2><p>As one of the most popular actors on the face of the planet, Robert Pattinson is someone that movie fans have been familiar with for years now. He got his career off to a hot start during his younger years, and since then, he has turned into one of the brightest stars in Hollywood, turning in exceptional performances along the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Harry Potter franchise proved to be a great way for Pattinson to introduce himself to mainstream audiences, and things ramped up from there once he was cast as Edward Cullen in the Twilight franchise.</p><p>Since his days playing a sparkling vampire, Pattinson has taken on a variety of projects. This allowed him time to develop his skills, and it also allowed him the chance to show audiences that he was far more than just a teen heartthrob. This paid off greatly, as people are now familiar with just how talented he is as a performer.</p><p>Earlier this year, Pattinson suited up for DC in The Batman, one of the biggest projects of 2022. The film was a monumental success, and it has already been confirmed that the Lighthouse actor will be playing the Caped Crusader once again.</p><p>Pattinson's had a wonderful career, and he has the net worth to prove it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Robert Pattinson Once Forgot Emma Watson's Name.

In the final two Twilight movies, Pattinson was given a generous piece of the backend revenues generated. These extra points brought his salary for each movie to $40 million. In 2011, Pattinson was 15th on Vanity Fair's "Hollywood Top 40" with earnings of $27.5 million in 2010," the site reports.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you can imagine, this number will only increase, especially as he continues his time playing the Dark Knight for DC.</p><p>Though he has the funds to purchase virtually any type of house that he desires, Pattinson made headlines a while back when he stopped up a relatively modest home down in beautiful Southern California.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Robert Pattinson Admitted He Felt "Intimidated" By 'Twilight' Co-Star Kristen Stewart</a></span></p><h2 id=robert-pattinson-preferred-a-modest-home>Robert Pattinson Preferred A Modest Home</h2><p>Okay, modest and Southern California real estate aren't terms that normally go together, but Pattinson's $2.1 million Hollywood Hills home is considerably cheaper and simpler than many others stars' abodes. That said, you had better believe that the Batman star got plenty of bang for his buck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, "Rustic and satisfyingly well-patinated terra cotta tile floors run throughout the interconnected main living spaces — the flooring switches to wood in the bedrooms — that include a reasonably roomy living room with multiple French doors that open to the yard. Twin arches flank a minimalist, double-sided fireplace and lead into a sky-lit, combination kitchen and dining area with vaulted, open beam ceiling and a full-complement of high-end stainless steel appliances, including a $14,000 U.K.-manufactured cast iron range."</p><p>The site also notes that the bedrooms each have custom wardrobes, as well as access to bathrooms and living spaces.</p><p>Clearly, the man knows a good interior, but the home's exterior is cozy, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"A brick veranda runs along the inside façade of the angled residence and gives way to a somewhat compact but remarkably private and tree-shaded yard with good-sized flat lawn, wee kidney-shaped swimming pool and rugged canyon views. Courtyard areas around the side and rear of the residence include variety of terraces and a secluded spa set into a brick terrace tightly girdled by a thick wall of privacy ensuring shrubbery," Dirt writes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Twilight' Crew Cautioned Robert Pattinson And Kristen Stewart Against Dating</a></span></p><p>In time, Pattinson could flip this home and go for something far more upscale.
