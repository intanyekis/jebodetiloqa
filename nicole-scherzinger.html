After attracting media attention, Antin negotiated a record deal with Interscope Geffen A&M Records in 2003 turning the group into a music franchise comprising Nicole Scherzinger, Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta, Melody Thornton, and Kimberly Wyatt. Overseen by Antin, Interscope, and various partners, the group was transformed into a global image and commercial brand. The Pussycat Dolls achieved worldwide success with hit singles “Don’t Cha”, “Buttons”, “Stickwitu”, and their first album PCD. However, despite their commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict due to the emphasis on Scherzinger, the group’s lead vocalist, and the subordinate treatment of the other members. Bachar’s departure from the group preceded the release of their second and final studio album Doll Domination, which contains singles “When I Grow Up”, “I Hate This Part”, and “Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)”.</p><h2>Nicole Scherzinger Music</h2><p>Described as being “provocative” when performing on stage, Scherzinger states that her stage persona “comes from a strong place, not a weak place, and there’s a big difference. There’s a big difference when you see someone who still has class and is empowering.”[17] Jarett Wieselman of The New York Post placed her at number two on his list of the Five Best Singer/Dancers,[125] while Rolling Stone magazine readers voted Scherzinger as the ninth Favorite Dancing Musician.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><h2>Nicole Scherzinger Album</h2><ul><li>Killer Love</li><li>Big Fat Lie</li></ul><h2>Nicole Scherzinger Facebook</h2><p>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Nicole Scherzinger Twitter</h2><p><a class=twitter-timeline data-width=500 data-height=750 data-dnt=true href=#>Tweets by NicoleScherzy</a></p><h2>Instagram Nicole Scherzinger</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h3>About InformationCradle Editorial Staff</h3><p>This Article is produced by <strong>InformationCradle Editorial Staff</strong> which is a team of expert<strong> writers</strong> and <strong>editors</strong> led by <a href=#><strong>Josphat Gachie</strong></a> and trusted by millions of readers worldwide.</p><p>We endeavor to keep our content <strong>True</strong>, <strong>Accurate</strong>, <strong>Correct</strong>, <strong>Original</strong> and <strong>Up to Date</strong>.
