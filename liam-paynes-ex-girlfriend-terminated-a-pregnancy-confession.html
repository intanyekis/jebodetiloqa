It’s just mind boggling to me that you could tell a woman how they’re going to feel."</p><p>The former couple were first linked in 2018, even getting engaged in 2020. But while promoting her book earlier this year, <a href=#>Maya said that year was particularly dark</a> . Her post caused fans to wonder if her book’s protagonist’s experience in an abusive relationship was inspired by her own.</p><p>“2020 was a dark and scary time for all of us.

Eventually, this journal evolved into a novel,” Maya continued. “I’m very nervous to share a project that was once my most personal outlet of joy and freedom - a story I never intended to share.”</p><p>She also gave a warning to readers about the strong subject matter but added she hopes it’s helpful to people who can relate.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/these-one-direction-members-only-became-friends-with-each-other-after-the-band-split-up-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="These One Direction Members Only Became Friends With Each Other After The Band Split Up">These One Direction Members Only Became Friends With Each Other After The Band Split Up</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Liam Payne has been candid about his tense relationship with one particular One Direction member.</p><p>“I hope that by doing so, anyone out there experiencing similar trauma and hardships as my main character will feel less alone.

However, they officially called it quits that same year, and given all Maya has said in the aftermath of their relationship, there doesn’t seem any hope these two will get back together. But what does seem likely s that fans will continue to speculate about the coupe’s mysterious break-up, including what parallels Maya’s book shares with her IRL experiences.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijopmdYr2ixc2eqmadqGK0qr7Ln6minZ6ZerWx0aagp5mkmrFurYypqZ6fnpa7pMWMnKannpWowKq7zWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happens-later-review-meg-ryan-youve-got-fail.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meg Ryan, you've got fail">&larr;
