The 66 years old is known for his work on the Discovery Network shows – Homestead Rescue and Homestead Rescue: Raney Ranch.</strong></p><p>Raney has amassed a net worth that is more than $1 million and has worked on several shows during his career. These long-running shows have been his biggest but not the only source of his wealth. He has been involved in a plethora of work which has contributed to making him a wealthy man as well as an expert on Mountain climbing and living in the wild.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=summary-of-marty-raneys-biography></span><strong>Summary of Marty Raney’s Biography</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Marty Raney</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>66 years</li><li><strong>Birthday</strong>: 1957</li><li><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Alaska, United States</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Caucasian</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=marty-raney-has-lived-in-alaska-all-his-life></span><strong>Marty Raney Has Lived in Alaska All His Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marty was born in Alaska, which is also where he spent his childhood. He decided to move away, far from other people, to forage and care for himself in the wild areas of Alaska when he turned 16. He made the decision to live off the grid for many years.</p><p>As an adult, his late teens and early 20s were spent in the wilderness, learning the way of the wild and how to survive in very extreme conditions.</p><p>As a result of this, there is not a lot of information available on his family – his parents and siblings or what his early childhood and teenage looked like.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-marty-raneys-net-worth></span><strong>How Much is Marty Raney’s Net Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marty Raney’s net worth is estimated to be around $1 million. This is just an estimation based on the work he has put in over the years. His net worth may be less or way more than this, but Marty Raney isn’t the type to put this kind of information about himself in the public space.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sources-of-marty-raneys-net-worth></span><strong>Sources of </strong><strong>Marty Raney’s Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=mountain-climbing></span><strong>Mountain Climbing</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Marty Raney moved away from his family when he was 16, and shortly after in 1974, he got married to his wife Molle Roestel. After their marriage, the couple relocated to the bear-populated area of Homestead in Haines, yet another wild area in the Alaskan wilderness with the added dangers of bears.</p><p>The couple lived there for 5 years before moving to the mountainous Wasilla area. This was where he started his career in Mountain climbing at the age of 23. This then bloomed into the mountain guide job that teaches people how to survive in the wild, especially in mountainous areas.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=acting></span><strong>Acting</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In his arsenal of jobs, Marty Raney also has experience working in films either as an actor or as a part of the crew. His appearances in a few films have him playing the role of his real-life job as a travel guide. He was in the “Spirit of Alaska” as a guide and worked as a sound man in “Surviving Denali”, a role he reprised in “Against All Odds”. “McKinley: Grand Mountain of the Far North”, “An Idiot Abroad”, and “Strummit From the Summit” are some of the other things he has worked on.</p><p><strong>Other Shows Marty Raney has Worked on include:</strong></p><ul><li>Climb Against all Odds</li><li>Han Denali</li><li>The High one</li><li>Josh Gates Tonight TV Series</li><li>An Uphill Battle</li><li>Denali Expedition</li></ul><p>Marty Raney has also had the opportunity to work on long-running series like “The Great Summit Series,” which featured a lot of mountain climbing, and “The Ultimate Survival Alaska” TV series, which was more focused on the ability to survive in very harsh and extreme conditions which Raney is no stranger to. This is very similar to his work on the “Homestead Rescue show”.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-was-marty-raney-when-he-joined-homestead-rescue></span><strong>How Old was Marty Raney When He Joined Homestead Rescue?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Marty Raney joined the Discovery Channel show “Homestead Rescue” in 2016 when he was 59 and well into his mountain climbing career. This was what kicked off his career in the media.</p><p>Homestead Rescue focuses on helping families who have decided to live off the grid, showing them the ropes and things they need to do to make the most of their new life, especially one as difficult as staying in the wild. These families need to learn the necessary craft skills, hunting and foraging skills, as well as know how to avoid predators.</p><p>Marty Raney was on the show for 5 years, from 2016 up until 2021, and in those 5 years, he has managed to create a legacy for himself and his family with the Homestead rescue brand that still lives on.</p><p>The show has gone on to have a spinoff, Homestead Rescue: Raney Ranch, where the family returned to their home location in Alaska to replicate what they did on the original show. This spinoff started in 2020 and lasted for 2 seasons ending in 2022.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-does-marty-raney-make-per-episode></span><strong>How Much Does Marty Raney Make per Episode?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The exact salary that Raney gets paid per episode is not known, but going by the standard rate for shows like Homestead Rescue, which is usually between $30,000 and $1 million for an entire season. It can be estimated that Marty Raney raked in about $10,000 per episode, and there could be cases of higher pay per episode.</p><p>Marty Raney has been on several shows, but it was not until Homestead Rescue did he achieve significant fame for his work.
