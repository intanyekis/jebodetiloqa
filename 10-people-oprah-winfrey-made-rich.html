Iyanla Vanzant - Net Worth: $200 Thousand</strong></h2><p>Her name means 'Great Mother' in Yoruba and eccentric job titles like&nbsp; 'priestess' and ordained New Thought minister didn't stop Oprah from taking <a title="Iyanla Vanzant Net Worth" href=#>Iyanla Vanzant</a> under her wing and making her a star. She made 20 appearances on <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show </i>between 1998-1999 and now enjoys the status of having the number one program on the OWN Network -&nbsp;<i>Iyanla: Fix My Life,</i> a reality show that uses Vanzant's skill as a life coach and motivational speaker to help 'fix' other people's problems. Named as one of the '100 most influential Black Americans' by <i>Ebony </i>magazine in 2000, it was recently announced that Iyanla is still in Lady O's good books. She will join the eight-city 'The Life You Want Weekend Tour' as a keynote speaker set to take place later this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-bob-greene---net-worth-1-4-million><strong>9. Bob Greene - Net Worth: $1.4 Million</strong></h2><p>How did fitness guru Bob Greene thank Oprah for making him a household name? By letting her be the 'best woman' at his 2005 wedding, of course. With a relationship that's spanned more than two decades, the health nut made over a dozen appearances on O's long-running talk show and pens a regular column in her magazine. He's also co-authored two books with the media guru and built a mini empire helping women get fit.&nbsp; Although&nbsp; Oprah's constant weight battle has put Greene under a&nbsp; microscope, you can't really lay <i>all </i>the blame on the go-to trainer.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-james-frey---net-worth-4-5-million><strong>8. James Frey -&nbsp;Net Worth: $4.5 Million</strong></h2><p>"Oprah annihilated Frey!" proclaimed &nbsp;suspender king <a title="Larry King Net Worth" href=#>Larry King</a> after&nbsp;<i>A Million Little Pieces&nbsp;</i>author, <a title="James Frey Net Worth" href=#>James Frey</a> was summoned to appear on 'Oprah Court' to defend himself in 2006. A year earlier, Frey's memoir had been chosen as an Oprah Book Club selection (ca-ching!) which soon after, became a huge success - a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>Best Seller and the number one paperback nonfiction book on Amazon.com. When it was discovered that much of Frey's memoir was fabricated, Oprah blasted him on air in front of her legions of viewers - a humiliation we thought he'd never overcome. Turns out, Frey did crawl out from under that rock. In 2007, the author signed a three-book, seven-figure deal with Harper Collins, and just this year, it was announced that Frey was working on a trilogy that will be turned into a reality game and movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-nate-berkus---net-worth-6-million><strong>7. Nate Berkus - Net Worth: $6 Million</strong></h2><p>Oprah was such a fan of interior decorator <a title="Nate Berkus Net Worth" href=#>Nate Berkus</a> that he became her go-to design guy: over the last ten years of <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i>, he made more than 50 guest appearances. With his signature flare for fashion, he's enjoyed international success thanks to a couple of bestselling books, his own talk show (co-produced by Harpo Productions), a Target Home Collection, and a fabric collection launched in 2013. He's also had the opportunity to dabble in acting, playing himself on the popular soap <i>Days of Our Lives </i>in 2011. Most recently, the design guru debuted <i>American Dream Builders, </i>an extreme home makeover reality show where he appears as judge and host.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-stedman-graham--net-worth-10-million><strong>6. Stedman Graham -Net Worth: $10 Million</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a title="Stedman Graham Net Worth" href=#>Stedman Graham</a> (a.k.a. 'Honey Graham') has been romantically involved with Ms. Winfrey since 1986.&nbsp; Famous first and foremost for being Oprah's main squeeze, he's also an educator, business consultant and author who has written more than ten business-related and self-help books. Stedman seems to spend as much of his time reminding us that he's more than just Oprah's boyfriend than we do talking about the fact that he's Oprah's boyfriend. "People put me in the box, you know. They define me by who she is, and she's a wonderful person and a great woman, but that's not&nbsp; - I'm not Oprah," he told <i>CBS This Morning </i>back in 2012. "That's who she is, that's not me."</p><p></p><h2 id=5-dr-oz---net-worth-14-million><strong>5. Dr. Oz - Net Worth: $14 Million</strong></h2><p>There's no medical issue Dr. Mehmet Oz won't tackle. He first garnered attention with regular appearances on <i>Oprah</i> and though he's been criticized by some for 'non-scientific' advice and his outspoken support of pseudosciences, this hasn't stopped him from becoming one of the most well-known doctors around. Now in its sixth season, <i>The <a title="Dr. Oz Net Worth" href=#>Doctor Oz</a> Show </i>(Oprah's second&nbsp; spin-off series featuring a regular guest) has enjoyed moderate success and earned him a number of accolades including a place on <i>Esquire </i>magazine's '75 Most Influential People of the 21st Century,'&nbsp; along with multiple Emmy Awards for Outstanding Talk Show and Host.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-gayle-king---net-worth-20-million><strong>4. Gayle King -&nbsp; Net Worth: $20 Million</strong></h2><p>One thing we can all agree on is that without Oprah nobody would know (or care) about <a title="Gayle King Net Worth" href=#>Gayle King</a>.&nbsp; She was somehow a <i>CBS This Morning</i> co-anchor, Editor-At-Large for <i>O, The Oprah Magazine</i>, recurring guest on <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i>, <i>Good Morning Americ</i>a special correspondent, a radio and a two-time talk show host.&nbsp; Most recently, King made headlines when she was snapped aboard Winfrey's yacht as they vacationed in the Virgin Islands. Noticeably absent? Oprah's partner of almost 30-years, Stedman Graham.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-suze-orman---net-worth-35-million><strong>3. Suze Orman - Net Worth: $35 Million</strong></h2><p>Self-proclaimed "financial truth crusader," <a title="Suze Orman Net Worth" href=#>Suze Orman</a> pens regular columns in <i>O Magazine</i> and was formerly host of the now defunct <i>America's Money Class </i>on the OWN Network.&nbsp; Oprah's "all-star" financial adviser was made a staple on<i> Oprah</i>.&nbsp; The two made headlines for their controversial episodes together, especially with 'octomom' Nadia Suleman (remember her?) in 2011.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-rachael-ray---net-worth-60-million><strong>2. Rachael Ray - Net Worth: $60 Million</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the beginning, bubbly chef du jour, <a title="Rachael Ray Net Worth" href=#>Rachael Ray</a> was turning heads - as much for her popular '30-Minute Meals' as she was for the sexy chocolate spoon licking, apron wearing photos that appeared in men's lifestyle magazine <i>FHM </i>in 2003. She caught the attention of Ms. Winfrey herself and in 2006, Oprah helped the perky brunette launch her own talk show, <i>Rachel Ray </i>that went on to win two consecutive Emmys in 2008 and 2009. Her empire currently includes more than 20 cookbooks, her own magazine, a kitchen and dinnerware line, a bunch of cooking products, and she even coined the phrase 'EVOO' (Extra Virgin Olive Oil), which was added to T<i>he Oxford College Dictionary</i> in 2007.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-dr-phil---net-worth-245-million><strong>1. Dr. Phil - Net Worth: $245 Million&nbsp;</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If those Texas cattle ranchers didn't have such a'beef' with Oprah, <a title="Dr. Phil Net Worth" href=#>Dr. Phil</a> would have never been. Before he became a household name, Phil McGraw was a happily married father of two with a P.h.D in psychology and a successful legal consulting business. That all changed in 1996 when he successfully helped the talk show host win a multi-million dollar lawsuit launched against her by angry ranchers who claimed she defamed the entire industry. He soon became a weekly staple thanks to 'Tuesdays with Dr. Phil' and won over Oprah's viewers with his straight talk and relationship advice. Today, Dr. Phil is a six-time #1 New York Times bestselling author and in 2002 launched his own successful talk show (produced by Harpo Productions) where he gives advice to troubled guests.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2lsrC8y55kqKiilrVuw8innaudqWK6orDEZqmim5hk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./florida-teens-lost-at-sea-no-data-recovered-from-iphone-w206086.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Florida Teens Lost at Sea: No Data Recovered From iPhone">&larr;
