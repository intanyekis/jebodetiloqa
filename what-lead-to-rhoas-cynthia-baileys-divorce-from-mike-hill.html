She was featured in the show until she made the decision to leave in 2021. The 2022 season of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, which was season 14, only showed Bailey through archive footage as she was no longer a member of the cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bailey married television personality Mike Hill in 2020. During the majority of her time on the Bravo show, however, Bailey was married to Peter Thomas. She was hesitant to dive into marriage with Hill, but chose to take the leap. Unfortunately, Bailey and Hill have separated and are now undergoing a divorce. Let’s get into what lead Cynthia Bailey and Mike Hill to get a divorce after only two years of marriage.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Nene Leakes Ended Her Friendship With ‘RHOA’ Star, Cynthia Bailey</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-cynthia-bailey><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Is Cynthia Bailey?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cynthia Bailey is a reality television star. She is known for her part in Bravo’s The Real Housewives of Atlanta. She joined the cast in 2010 when she was engaged to Peter Thomas. Their wedding was featured in the third season of the hit Bravo television show. Her ex-husband was rumored to have been dating Gizelle Bryant, but Bryant squashed the rumors immediately.</p><p>After being on The Real Housewives of Atlanta for 11 years, Bailey made the decision to leave the show. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Honestly, I have had a good run</a>,” she told Entertainment Tonight, ‘it was just time, and I think not only was it time, it was the right time.” Bailey has not ruled out returning to the show in the future.</p><h2 id=who-is-mike-hill><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Who Is Mike Hill?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mike Hill is a television talk show host, specifically in regards to sports. He won two Emmy Awards in the late 1990s while he was covering high school football in Nashville, Tennessee. Over the years, Hill has worked for both ESPN and Fox Sports.</p><p>While with Cynthia Bailey, Hill appeared on The Real Housewives of Atlanta many times. His work was primarily done in Los Angeles and New York, however, so he did not appear as frequently as other husbands. He promised to Bailey in 2019 and the two were married in October 2020.</p><h2 id=steve-harvey-was-the-reason-bailey-and-hill-met><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Steve Harvey Was The Reason Bailey And Hill Met</span></h2><p>Celebrities from different parts of the entertainment industry have to meet somehow. Fans always wonder how people from such different worlds end up together. In the case of Cynthia Bailey and Mike Hill, their introduction is all thanks to <a href=#>Family Feud host Steve Harvey</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Bailey and Hill were slated to appear on The Steve Harvey Show in April 2018. While on set, the two really hit it off. Bailey and Hill made their relationship public later that year. Who knew Steve Harvey was secretly a matchmaker?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>RHOA’s Drew Sidora’s Dating History, Explained</a></span></p><h2 id=cynthia-bailey-gave-up-on-marriage-after-peter-thomas><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Cynthia Bailey Gave Up On Marriage After Peter Thomas</span></h2><p>Before Mike Hill was in the picture, Cynthia Bailey was married to Peter Thomas. They split in 2016 after continuously having marital issues. Their problems were highlighted in Bravo’s The Real Housewives of Atlanta.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following her divorce from Thomas, Bailey had very negative feelings towards marriage. “I was like, ‘<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I don’t know if I’d ever get married again</a>,’” she said about her outlook on marriage. “I’d just given up on the whole marriage thing.” When Hill came into the picture, however, she told Us Weekly, “Now, my answer has changed.”</p><h2 id=mike-hill-proposed-at-opening-of-bailey-wine-cellar><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mike Hill Proposed At Opening Of Bailey Wine Cellar</span></h2><p>Outside of her success on Bravo’s The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Cynthia Bailey is also a highly successful businesswoman. She had been working on opening up The Bailey Wine Cellar, and Hill used the opening of the wine bar <a href=#>to show Bailey how much he loved her and supported her</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The opening of The Bailey Wine Cellar was in July 2019 in Atlanta. Hill proposed to Bailey at the opening with a stunning ring. Fans of Bailey were overjoyed that she had once again found love and would be getting married in 2020.</p><h2 id=do-cynthia-bailey-and-mike-hill-have-kids><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Do Cynthia Bailey And Mike Hill Have Kids?</span></h2><p>Cynthia Bailey and Mike Hill do not have kids together, which does make their separation a bit easier since they will not be battling over any sort of custody. Both have children from previous relationships and their children older. Bailey has one daughter named Noelle. She was born in 1999 and her father is Bailey’s ex-boyfriend Leon Robinson.</p><p>Hill also has children of his own. He has two daughters, one from each of his previous marriages. His daughters’ names are Kayla and Ashleé.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was Claudia Jordan Fired From ‘RHOA’?

Mike Hill cheated on both of his previous wives, and while he claimed he was a changed man, Bailey still worried he would be unfaithful.</p><p>“I think I’m getting Mike at the best time in his life, right now. But he has cheated on his [two previous] wives before me. What makes me different?” Bailey stated during an episode of The Real Housewives of Atlanta. Many think <a href=#>her issues with Mike Hill caused Bailey to leave the Bravo show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=long-distance-caused-cynthia-bailey-and-mike-hill-to-divorce><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Long-Distance Caused Cynthia Bailey And Mike Hill To Divorce</span></h2><p>When Cynthia Bailey and Mike Hill announced they were getting a divorce, fans immediately wondered if Bailey’s fears of infidelity had become a reality. Bailey quickly shut down the rumors, saying “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">There was no infidelity to my knowledge</a>. Mike never had sex with another woman during our marriage.”</p><p>Instead, the end of Bailey and Hill’s marriage stems from a lack of happiness. There is much love and respect between the exes, but long distance was not working. Bailey did not want to waste either her time or Hill’s time on a relationship that needed to end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrmmrcNmq6hlop28or%2BMnLCnrJierm6uwKKjnrGjYrGqws6rmp5llqe8rnnMoqKeZZieua17</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-dannielynn-birkhead-in-2022-what-is-anna-nicole-smith-daughter-net-worth-384527-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Is Dannielynn Birkhead In 2022?
