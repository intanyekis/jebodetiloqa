Die-hard fans have gone from having posters of the J0 Bros in their childhood rooms to jamming out to "Sucker" in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Jonas Brothers' 10 Most Viewed Music Videos On Youtube</a></span></p><p>Of course, these famous, handsome, and talented boys have certainly gone through many relationships in the eyes of the public. Fans were certainly behind many, while some, they weren't super crazy about. So, it's time to stack up their relationships once and for all, from least supported to those that fans totally 'stanned'.</p><h2 id=joe-jonas-amp-aj-michalka><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Joe Jonas & AJ Michalka</span></h2><p>The Jonas Brothers and Aly & AJ actually toured together in 2006, and apparently, things were quick to heat up between Joe and AJ. They were young, but they actually stayed together for just about a year!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These two music groups were at the <a href=#>height of popularity in the 2000s</a>, so this young love was definitely making headlines and making every young fan totally infatuated with it.</p><h2 id=kevin-jonas-amp-zoe-myers><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Kevin Jonas & Zoe Myers</span></h2><p>Zoe Myers made an appearance in the music video for "Year 3000", back in 2013, and dated Kevin Jonas for a brief time after that. While the Jo Bros were making it big, fans couldn't help but be totally interested in this relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Couples Who Broke Up A Few Times Before Tying The Knot</a></span></p><p>Of course, it was also the first mention of Kevin's love life, and fans could hardly contain their excitement. Still, it's one of the lesser-known relationships from this trio, even though rumor has it "Video Girl" is about Myers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-jonas-amp-taylor-swift><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Joe Jonas & Taylor Swift</span></h2><p>This relationship from 2008 might just be one of the funniest things to discuss now in 2020. Their fling lasted a few months, and there was certainly some bad blood that came out in many interviews - since Joe dumped Taylor over the phone.</p><p>Since then, though, the two have done nothing but laugh about, and Taylor Swift reconciled her hate with Ellen DeGeneres, laughing at her <a href=#>young broken heart</a>.</p><h2 id=nick-jonas-amp-olivia-culpo><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Nick Jonas & Olivia Culpo</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This relationship was one of Nick's first serious, and most public, relationships. This Jonas brother dated Olivia for two years, from 2013 to 2015. This woman was Miss Universe, so fans were definitely keeping an eye on their relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Famous Celebrity Couples Who Broke Up Before Their First Anniversary</a></span></p><p>Plus, this love is said to have spawned Jonas' hit song, "Jealous", so it's hard not to have at least some support for this infamous relationship.</p><h2 id=joe-jonas-amp-gigi-hadid><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Joe Jonas & Gigi Hadid</span></h2><p>These two definitely turned heads back in 2015 when they first spotted together. Not only is Gigi one of Taylor Swift's best friends, but these two <a href=#>stunning people</a> were making everyone swoon during some PDA.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this beautiful couple sizzled out after about half a year, which had all fans' hearts in turmoil. Clearly, everyone's gotten over it since, though.</p><h2 id=nick-jonas-amp-miley-cyrus><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Nick Jonas & Miley Cyrus</span></h2><p>These two were <a href=#>huge Family Channel stars way back</a> in the 2000s, so it's not totally surprising that these stunning and talented celebrities fell head over heels for each other - when they were just 13.</p><p>However, they actually lasted a surprisingly long time, and these two have had nothing but kind words to say about one another. This young love still makes all fans totally giddy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-jonas-amp-demi-lovato><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Joe Jonas & Demi Lovato</span></h2><p>Things definitely got interesting for fans when Joe Jonas started dating Demi Lovato, fellow Disney Channel star and co-star from&nbsp;Camp Rock.&nbsp;They dated for less than a year, but it was all anyone could talk about at the time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Demi Lovato and Max Ehrich: A Timeline Of Their Whirlwind Relationship</a></span></p><p>Of course, since then, Demi and Nick had a tight friendship, and fans were far too invested in all things to do with the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato.</p><h2 id=kevin-jonas-amp-danielle-jonas><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kevin Jonas & Danielle Jonas</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These two are literally couple of the year and have been since about 2007. Kevin didn't need to date a bunch of gals before he <a href=#>found the one in Danielle</a>, and they got engaged (and married!) two years after meeting.</p><p>They have two daughters and have been going strong ever since. These two are definitely couple goals, even if they like to keep their private life, well, private.</p><h2 id=nick-jonas-amp-priyanka-chopra><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Nick Jonas & Priyanka Chopra</span></h2><p>Obviously, regardless of how much fans loved Nick and Olivia or Nick and Miley, these brothers have long since tied the knot with their true soulmates. Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas are <a href=#>definitely a power couple</a>.</p><p>Their huge and long-lasting wedding was everything anyone could talk about for some time, and these two stunning humans are certainly far from afraid of the limelight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-jonas-amp-sophie-turner><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Joe Jonas & Sophie Turner</span></h2><p>Most people have gotten over Joe's previous relationships, and it's likely because he's with his <a href=#>true soulmate now</a> - Sophie Turner. This boy band star and this&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;alumni probably couldn't get any cuter.</p><p>From heartfelt posts to hilarious interviews, fans can't get enough of this pair - and their more secretive relationship has everyone totally obsessed. They also just welcomed a new baby into the world - and fans can barely handle it.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Timeline Of Miley Cyrus' Relationships, Updated 2020</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKaRqHqjvs6tn56qo2K0qr7Ln6minZ6ZwG6ywKeqZqSfq7Kleceaq56cXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lauren-sisler.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lauren Sisler Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Engaged, Husband, ESPN, Salary, Net Worth">&larr;
