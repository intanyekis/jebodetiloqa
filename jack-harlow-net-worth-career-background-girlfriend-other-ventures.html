It’s funny how, as you grow older, you have more opportunities. However, because the stakes are high, you close up a little.”</p><p>“There’s also a stigma around it,” he continued. I remember seeing artists my age talking about how girls wanted him just because he was a rapper when I was younger. That was amazing to me. I couldn’t wait for girls to fall in love with me just because I became an artist.”</p><p>He did, however, state that “now I have no interest in that.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Social_Media></span>Social Media<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of this writing, Jack Harlow’s net worth is $5 million, but his social media following is much larger.
