Despite her close relationship with fellow co-stars, Kristen, Brittany, and Katie, it appears as if Kent is no longer friendly with original castmate, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scheana Marie.</a></p><p>The duo was close at one point however, things just haven't been the same. While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scheana and Stassi are no longer friends</a>, fans are curious as to what really happened between the two and where Lala and Scheana stand today.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>An Inside Look: Vanderpump Editors Actually Conspired Against Scheana Shay</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-between-lala-amp-scheana>What Happened Between Lala & Scheana?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scheana Marie first debuted on our screens way back during her time on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. While she started off her reality TV career in a spat with former RHOBH star, Brandi Glanville, that wouldn't be the end of it for Scheana.</p><p>The star was later cast on Vanderpump Rules alongside Stassi Schroeder, Kristen Doute, and Katie Maloney. As the show progresses, newer characters were introduced, Lala Kent being one of them.</p><p>After appearing on seasons 4 and 5 in a recurring role, Lala was officially cast as a full-time cast member come season 6. Although she got on great with Scheana at first, things between the two are simply, no longer.</p><p>While Lala is known for her spicy personality, the star has been in a feud or five during her time on the show, especially with former co-star, Billie Lee. In addition to her many tiffs, Lala had a very <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">public feud with 50 Cent</a>, showcasing that her ability to find herself in hot waters is unparalleled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, now it seems as if it's Scheana's turn, and Lala is now revealing what led to their rift!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>'I Didn't Grow Up Like This': Lala Kent Claps Back At Mom-Shaming Troll</a></span></p><p>During her time on Lisa Vanderpump's newest show, Overserved, Lisa inquired about her friendship with Scheana Marie. "Have you seen her [Scheana]?" Lisa asked. "Who?" Lala replied, not because she didn't hear right, but because she was being her shady self.</p><p>"I don't recall," she went on. Lisa then asked if she and Scheana are "friendly" and it was clear that they were not! Lala revealed that the reason why they had a falling out was all <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">due to Lala's gender reveal party.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"What triggered it, is that I didn't invite her to my gender reveal," Lala shared. "She turned it into a platform for her low-level podcast! Just don't make my gender reveal about you," Lala finished.</p><p>Actress Anna Camp was also present and made it clear that she would "never wanna be on your [Lala's] bad side," and neither would we! Scheana also did not invite Lala to her own baby shower, something fans definitely saw coming.</p><p>Although they've had their issues in the past, Lala revealed that it was "the last moment" that Scheana would be getting from her, however, fans aren't so sure if that's true.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Does Scheana Shayâ€™s Boyfriend Brock Davies Do For A Living?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BmrculsGagkaW9prrEnWSbnaSssqa6jKWYpZldoLKvwIyapZ1lo5i1pq3NmmSmmaKesnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wiki-height-age-ethnicity-net-worth-and-career-of-ilhan-omar.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wiki, Height, Age, Ethnicity, Net Worth, And Career Of Ilhan Omar">&larr;
