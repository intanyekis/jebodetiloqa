His sentence was extended after he confessed to smuggling drugs into jail. The <a href=#>Long Way Home </a>author was <a href=#>released early in August 2016</a> and has since become clean.</p><p>“It was years of my behavior [that added to] us not really having much of a relationship … [starting] since I was an early teen,” Cameron told Us on Friday. “It was never a nasty relationship, you know, we always sort of had a good time together and obviously love each other. It just wasn’t much there because I wasn’t available.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Inside-Cameron-Douglas-Relationship-With-Dad-Michael-After-Getting-Clean-inline.jpg><p>The California native — <a href=#>who shares Lua, 5, and Ryder, 2</a>, with partner <strong>Viviane Thibes</strong> — added: “It took a little while for him to sort of trust me again and realize that things [had] changed. [I’m] grateful for that and now we’re <a href=#>able to enjoy each other’s company</a> on a regular basis and not just, like, once in a blue moon.”</p><p>The father-son duo’s positive connection has led to them teaming up for the upcoming movie Blood Knot. (Michael shares Cameron with his first wife, <strong>Diandra Luker</strong>. The Oscar winner is also father of <a href=#>son Dylan, 22, and daughter Carys, 20</a>, whom he shares with wife <a href=#><strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones</strong></a>.)</p><p>“I’m looking forward to that experience. It’s gonna be fun shooting down in Belize,” Cameron explained, revealing, “Actually, I don’t have any scenes with him. But I’m just happy to be doing it with him.”</p><p>The Wire Room actor gushed over his dad, calling him “fantastic.” Cameron also said that Michael is a spitting image of his own father, <a href=#>the late Kirk Douglas</a>.</p><p>“He’s reminding me a lot of my grandfather. He’s like a force of nature. He just loves the work and [he’s] built to continue doing it,” Cameron said of the Basic Instinct star. “He’s a great role model and we’ve been having some fun lately. So it’s been nice.”</p><p>The Fatal Attraction actor and <a href=#>his eldest son</a> previously worked together on 2003’s It Runs in the Family. The movie also starred the Douglas’ patriarch, Kirk, <a href=#>who died in February 2020 at age 103</a>.</p><p>In addition to getting back into acting, Cameron has continued to share <a href=#>his story of addiction and recovery</a>, including a recent chat Addition Talk chat featured on the American Addiction Centers’ website.</p><p>“If my experiences can be helpful, then all the better,” he said of his choice to continually speak up. “So if there’s a platform where that’s possible and it makes sense, then I’m certainly open to it.”</p><p>The author added that life is a “process” and he is looking for “elevation” as well as changing for the better. “I’m definitely inspired and fulfilled. But I’m hungry and I think that’s good,” Cameron concluded.</p><p>Listen to Cameron’s <a href=#>Addiction Talk episode here</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>If you or anyone you know is facing substance abuse issues, call the <a href=#>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s National Helpline</a> at 1-800-662-4357 for free and confidential information 24/7.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZ2av7C6jKagnKCRmrlusM6unqWZo2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF5z6iqrWWRmbGqr9OipqdllJrBorXLrGY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chief-keef-daughter-kay-kay.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chief Keef Daughter: Kay Kay Bio, Wiki, Age, Parents">&larr;
