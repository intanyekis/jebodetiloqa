She was born in Los Angeles, California, on August 22, 2021, and is the only child of Stephanie Beatriz and Brad Hoss.</p><p>Rosaline Hoss is an American citizen born under the Leo zodiac sign and is of mixed ethnicity. She has Colombian, German, Sephardi Jewish, Dutch, Basque, Spanish, Bolivian, and White ancestry.</p><p>Her parents have diligently fulfilled their responsibilities in providing her with the kind of life one would expect for a child born into a prominent family. Rosaline Hoss is still fully dependent on her parents, and as a result, much is not known about her. Due to this, the names and locations of the schools that Stephanie Beatriz’s daughter attends are not known. She is still a toddler and has not started pursuing a career yet.</p><h3><strong>Who Was Rosaline Hoss Named After?</strong></h3><p>Stephanie Beatriz named her daughter Rosaline after her iconic character, Detective Rosa Diaz, from the hit TV series Brooklyn Nine-Nine. This character was pivotal in her career, marking her breakthrough role and introducing her to a wider American audience. She attributes the show to being a significant stepping stone in her Hollywood journey, as it propelled her into various opportunities in the entertainment industry.</p><p>In a gesture of gratitude and acknowledgment, Stephanie decided to honor her character by naming her daughter Rosa Diaz. It’s a meaningful homage to the role that not only brought her fame but also symbolized her career’s growth.</p><p>At first, when questioned by the media about the inspiration behind her daughter’s name, Stephanie claimed that she chose the name in honor of various family members. She specifically mentioned that a family member had named their child Rosario, and so she thought naming her daughter Rosaline was a fitting choice. However, this explanation didn’t quite convince many people who were curious about the origin of the name at that time.</p><h2><strong>Who are Rosaline Hoss’ Parents?</strong></h2><p>Rosaline Hoss’s parents are Stephanie Beatriz and Brad Hoss.
