There’s the wedding dress, of course, venues, guests, food, wedding party, and the one that does it all, the wedding officiant. Without someone to officiate your wedding, it can’t happen. These days, anyone can become a wedding officiant, as long as you get certified to do so. Which is why, many celebrities have added wedding officiant to the resumes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Celebrity Wedding Dresses Of All Time</a></span></p><p>You’d be surprised to find out just how many celebrities are able to officiate weddings, and how many have already done so. From doing it for fans, family and friends, and even for the good of others, there are a lot more celebrity wedding officiants out there than you realize. If you can’t marry your favorite celeb, you can always have them officiate your marriage!</p><h2 id=kesha><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Kesha</span></h2><p>For her entire career, <a href=#>Kesha</a> has been outspoken about being an advocate for LGBTQ rights. As a result, she became a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding officiant</a> and put it to good use when she officiated a same-sex wedding in 2018. The wedding took place at the Bellagio in Las Vegas and was on the anniversary of the very first same-sex marriage license issued in the United States on March 26, 2975.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebs Who Called Off Their Weddings Last Minute</a></span></p><p>On top of that, she also released a music video for her song "I Need a Woman to Love" where she officiated a same-sex marriage in the music video. Kesha is outspoken about LGBTQ rights and what better way to spread love than by marrying people of the same sex?</p><h2 id=dwayne-the-rock-johnson><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</span></h2><p><a href=#>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</a> became a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding officiant</a> for a very good reason — to surprise a fan. Comedian Nick Mundy is a huge fan of The Rock, and he was shocked when he found out that The Rock would be his wedding officiant. The whole thing was a surprise, even the wedding itself. Nick thought he was just interviewing The Rock, and little did he know, he was actually getting married. It was definitely the surprise of a lifetime for Nick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jimmy-kimmel><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jimmy Kimmel</span></h2><p>We all know that <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel</a> has that long-running joke that there's a feud between him and Matt Damon. Obviously, the feud is fake as not only was Jimmy Kimmel invited to Matt and his wife Luciana's vow renewal. The vow renewal took place in St. Lucia, and Jimmy was the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding officiant</a>. There were tons of stars in attendance and of course, Jimmy had to put his own spin on the ceremony, making it funny. We'd like to think that Jimmy would be the perfect celebrity to officiate a wedding.</p><h2 id=queen-latifah><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Queen Latifah</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Queen Latifiah</a> became a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding officiant</a> for a great reason. In 2014, during the Grammy awards, she officiated 33 marriages. When Macklemore and Ryan Lewis performed their song "Same Love," a song all about marriage equality. During the performance, Queen Latifah simultaneously officiated all 33 weddings of all different sexual orientations. It&nbsp;was definitely the perfect way to use her power as a wedding officiant&nbsp;for a good reason, and that's to spread love!</p><h2 id=stevie-nicks><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Stevie Nicks</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Stevie Nicks</a> is another celebrity who has the ability to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">officiate weddings</a>. Can you imagine having a legend like Stevie Nicks attending your wedding&nbsp;and officiating the whole thing? For singer Vanessa Carlton, she had the awesome opportunity to have Stevie officiate her marriage to fellow singer John McCauley. The two shared multiple pictures of the nuptials on Instagram, along with Stevie sharing that she officiated the big day. We'd definitely ask Stevie to officiate our wedding.</p><h2 id=tom-hanks><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tom Hanks</span></h2><p><a href=#>Tom Hanks</a> seems like he would be the perfect <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding officiant</a>, and he pretty much is. Actress Allison Williams had Tom Hanks as her wedding officiant. Thanks to family friend Rita Wilson, wife of Tom Hanks, she was able to convince Tom to officiate their wedding, which wouldn't be a problem since he was already a wedding officiant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>2020 Celebrity Weddings That Were Postponed Because Of Quarantine</a></span></p><p>According to Allison, Tom was the perfect person to marry her and her husband Ricky Van Veen. He exceeded all of their expectations, and she thought he was an amazing officiant as he's so incredibly charismatic and entertaining. He made their wedding a special one, and who knows, he might have a career as a wedding officiant in the future.</p><h2>Mark Consuelos</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Actor <a href=#>Mark Consuelos</a>&nbsp;is a man of many talents, one of them being a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding officiant</a>. After getting certified online, Mark was able to start marrying couples. Back in 2008, he married another pretty big celebrity couple — Howard Stern and Beth Ostrosky. Mark got ordained online solely for the purpose of marrying Howard and Beth. With all of the celebrities in attendance, Mark was pretty nervous, especially because it was the first wedding he ever officiated. Thankfully, he did really well, and now he has a second job as a wedding officiant whenever someone is in need!</p><h2 id=lady-gaga><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Lady Gaga</span></h2><p>Out of all of the celebrities who could be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding officiants</a>, <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> seems like she would be a pretty good one. With her over-the-top fashion and&nbsp;her allyship with the LGBTQ community, Lady Gaga would make the perfect person to marry any couple. After same-sex marriage became legal in New York, Lady Gaga went and got ordained because she wanted to be able to marry her friend and yoga teacher Tricia Donegan and her partner. Lady Gaga as an ordained minister would quite an entertaining wedding ceremony, that's for sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steve-harvey><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Steve Harvey</span></h2><p><a href=#>Steve Harvey</a> is a pretty entertaining TV host, so it only makes sense that he would be a pretty good <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding officiant</a>. He got to show off his skill on television when he officiated the marriage of fellow television host Maria Menounos and her now-husband Keven Undergaro. They were hosting Fox's New Year's Eve broadcast when the surprise wedding took place. The world got to witness Steve Harvey officiate and Maria have the surprise wedding of her dreams. Is there anything Steve Harvey can't do?</p><h2 id=jonah-hill><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jonah Hill</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Jonah Hill</a> doesn't seem like he'd be a celebrity to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">officiate weddings</a>, however, he is indeed a wedding officiant and has officiated the wedding of none other than Adam Levine. Jonah and Adam are very close friends. The two are so close that Jonah was happy to officiate Adam's wedding to model Behati Prinsloo. We love that the two have such an unlikely friendship, and we love it even more that Jonah stepped up to officiate Adam and Behati. Jonah might have a future as a professional wedding officiant.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebrities With The Most Expensive Weddings</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKR6pK3NZqafnpmYtqLAxGaunpyUnruov44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./braves-matt-olson-home-run-pace.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Braves continue relentless pace as Matt Olsons grand slam fuels rout of White Sox">&larr;
