She was born on <strong>February 9, 2014,</strong> in West Palm Beach, Florida, and has a twin sister named Victoria. Ysabel is the fourth child of Michael Jordan and the second child of Yvette Prieto. Here is a detailed biography timeline of Ysabel Jordan.</p><ul><li><strong>2014:</strong> Ysabel Jordan was born on <strong>February 9, 2014,</strong> in West Palm Beach, Florida, to Michael Jordan and Yvette Prieto.</li><li><strong>2015:</strong> Ysabel makes her first public appearance at Michael Jordan’s annual golf tournament, the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational.</li><li><strong>2016:</strong> Ysabel and her twin sister, Victoria, are baptized at the Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach, Florida.</li><li><strong>2018: </strong>Ysabel, her mother, and her siblings attend her father’s induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts.</li><li><strong>2020:</strong> Ysabel and her family move into a new home in The Bear’s Club, a luxury golf community in Jupiter, Florida.</li><li><strong>2021:</strong> Ysabel celebrates her seventh birthday with a private party at home, surrounded by family and friends.</li></ul><p>Ysabel Jordan is still very young but has made several public appearances with her famous parents. Despite growing up in the spotlight, Ysabel and her siblings are raised to have a normal childhood and are shielded from the media as much as possible. As she continues to grow and develop, Ysabel will become a prominent figure in her own right, and her family’s legacy in sports and entertainment will continue to inspire future generations.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=early-life-and-childhood><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood><strong>Early Life and Childhood</strong></span></h3><p>Ysabel Jordan was born with her twin sister, Victoria Jordan, on February 9, 2014. Her parents want her to live an everyday life away from public and media attention; they have not revealed anything about Ysabel and Victoria. Furthermore, Ysabel Jordan has two step-brothers, Jeffrey and Marcus, and a step-sister, Jasmine, from her father’s past relationship with <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title="Juanita Vanoy" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Juanita Vanoy</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ysabel-Jordan-Age.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=professional-life><span id=Professional_Life><strong>Professional Life</strong></span></h3><p>Ysabel is currently just a seven-year-old kid, so she is more focused on her studies than involved in any profession. She will surely get a job suited to her talent shortly. But for now, she has not decided on her career yet.</p><p>However, her father, Jordan, is widely recognized as one of the best basketball players and has achieved several accomplishments throughout his career. In addition, Jordan became a member of the ‘FIBA Hall of Fame’ in 2015. Moreover, he is recognized as the first billionaire player in NBA history and the third-richest African–American. He is known worldwide by millions of fans and followers due to his outstanding skills and talents. So, Ysabel caught the media’s attention and the public worldwide even though she was not born. The couple was not expecting twins, though. So, when Jordan and Prieto announced the birth of Ysabel and her identical twin, Victoria, to the world, everyone was surprised.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=personal-life><span id=Personal_Life><strong>Personal Life</strong></span></h3><p>Ysabel Jordan is just a seven-year-old kid, so she is not mature enough to be in any relationship or love affair. She will surely get the love of her life once she gets mature enough.</p><p>Talking about her parents’ love life, the beautiful couple, Jordan and Prieto, first met at a club in 2007. Eventually, they started dating for several years. After that, Jordan proposed to Prieto on Christmas 2011, and the duo tied the knot. Jordan and Prieto exchanged the marriage vows in a wedding ceremony held at the ‘Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church’ on April 27, 2013.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=height-weight-and-body-measurements><span id=Height_Weight_and_Body_Measurements><strong>Height, Weight, and Body Measurements</strong></span></h3><p>We could not find any information regarding Ysabel’s height, weight, and other measurements such as waist, hip, chest, etc. As she grows, her body measurements will gradually increase in the future.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=net-worth-and-social-media><span id=Net_Worth_and_Social_Media><strong>Net Worth and Social Media</strong></span></h3><p>As mentioned earlier, Ysabel has not decided on her career yet and is not involved in any profession. So, we could not determine Ysabel’s actual net worth. However, her dad, Michael Jordan, is a billionaire with a net worth of $1.6 billion.</p><p>Ysabel is very young to be on social media platforms. So, she has no personal accounts on social media sites such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=trivia><span id=Trivia><strong>Trivia</strong></span></h3><ul><li>Her birthday falls on February 9; She is 9 years old.</li><li>She gained immense popularity for being the daughter of renowned NBA superstar Michael Jordan and his second wife, Yvette Prieto.</li><li>Ysabel Jordan was born with her twin sister, Victoria Jordan, on February 9, 2014.</li><li>Her father, Jordan, is widely recognized as one of the best basketball players of all time and has achieved several accomplishments throughout his career.</li><li>Ysabel has no personal accounts on social media sites like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.</li><li>However, her dad, Michael Jordan, is a billionaire with a net worth of $1.6 billion.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></span></h3><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Ysabel Jordan?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Ysabel Jordan is the daughter of former professional basketball player Michael Jordan.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><strong>When was Ysabel Jordan born?</strong></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Ysabel Jordan was born on February 9, 2014.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>How old is Ysabel Jordan?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Ysabel Jordan is 9 years old.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Does Ysabel Jordan have any siblings?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Yes, Ysabel Jordan has a twin sister named Victoria Jordan.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>What is the relationship between Ysabel Jordan and Michael Jordan?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Ysabel Jordan is the biological daughter of Michael Jordan.
