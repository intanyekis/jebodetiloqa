Their 16-year marriage from 1978 to 1994 produced three children: Annie, Lily, and Joe. As the Robin Hood star gained more popularity in the early '90s, rumors of infidelity began to swirl. Eventually, <a href=#>they had an amicable divorce</a> with Silva receiving an $80 million settlement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Costner went on to date multiple A-listers following the split. The long list includes Naomi Campbell, Courtney Cox, Elle MacPherson, Halle Berry, and Michelle Pfeiffer. In 1996, The Bodyguard actor welcomed a fourth child, Liam, from his brief affair with Bridget Rooney. It got a little messy with <a href=#>Costner asking Rooney for a paternity test</a>.</p><p>After living such a colorful bachelor life, the Waterworld star finally settled with Christine Baumgartner whom he's been married to since 2003. The two have three kids who are <a href=#>all close with Costner's older children</a>. The actor initially refused to have more children, but Baumgartner managed to convince him. She's obviously unlike any of the actor's exes. So we took the time to find out what makes the model-turned-handbag designer so special.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bobby Brown Agrees With Fans That Remaking Whitney Houston's 'The Bodyguard' Is A 'Bad Move'</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-christine-baumgartner>Who Is Christine Baumgartner?</h2><p>Coincidentally, Baumgartner also went to California State University Fullerton where Costner and his first wife met. There, she completed a Degree in Business. The model is 19 years younger than the Yellowstone star. The 47-year-old was born on March 4, 1974, while her husband, 66, was born on January 18, 1955. The actor later admitted that the age gap initially stopped him from pursuing his future wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Fear kept me from marrying Christine. [She] wanted a child," shared Costner who was already a father of four when he met Baumgartner. It caused the Field of Dreams actor to step away from their relationship. "She said, 'Iâ€™m going to wait for you, but not long. When you come to your senses, come back to me.' And I did," the two-time Oscar winner revealed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Kevin Costner's Lost Role In 'The Big Chill'</a></span></p><h2 id=what-does-christine-baumgartner-do>What Does Christine Baumgartner Do?</h2><p>Aside from professional modeling, Baumgartner's Business degree enabled her to make a name for herself in fashion. She's the owner of Cat Bag Couture, a line of stylish carrier bags. Some of her daytime purses were sported by the lead actresses of Desperate Housewives in its pilot episode in 2005. Her products can be bought online and in some specialty stores.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from being a regular red carpet companion to her husband, Baumgartner has also had her own appearances on screen. She's been featured in specials in Primetime, Biography, Die Johannes B. Kerner Show, Inside Edition, Entertainment Tonight, and Extra. Lately, she's been keeping a low profile and is focused on raising her young children with Costner: Cayden, 14; Hayes, 12; and Grace, 11.</p><h2 id=how-did-kevin-costner-meet-christine-baumgartner>How Did Kevin Costner Meet Christine Baumgartner?</h2><p>Costner first met Baumgartner when she was still modeling in the '80s. It was in a golf course where the actor was practicing for his role in Tin Cup. The Revenge star was still married to his first wife so it wasn't until 1998 that the two started to get involved. After running into each other at a Hollywood restaurant, Costner decided to get her number and said he'd call her in two weeks. Since then, the two were inseparable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When I met Christine, I wasn't prepared to be in love again. It took me a long time before I said 'I love you' to her," the actor said about crossing paths with Baumgartner again. In 2002, however, Costner suddenly had cold feet. He realized that he wasn't ready for the family Baumgartner wanted to have with him. But then he realized that he really wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. He said: "I woke up and thought, 'Am I going to lose a beautiful woman who is willing to be with me to my very last breath because I am afraid to say yes to a child?'"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Timeline Of Halle Berry's Romantic Relationships</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple got engaged in 2003 and tied the knot in 2004 in the actor's 165-acre Colorado ranch just outside Aspen. The Let Him Go star made his entrance in a covered wagon while his bride arrived in a vintage green pickup truck. Costner also gave Baumgartner a new and larger diamond ring after her first vintage engagement ring was dissed by Joan Rivers at the Golden Globes â€” "It should be four times that size!" The Saturday ceremony had 300 guests including Tim Allen and Bruce Willis.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Did Hugh Jackman Meet His Wife Of 25 Years, Deborra-Lee Furness?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecqeraKmXZi8tMDNnqlmpZWawW60yKxknK2ip7KvwIywoJ%2BdXZi1s7XSraCnnV2Xrra5xpqpraaVp3qiusNmrqGZpGKxsLHSZqqhnV2ZvHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-villarreal-where-is-mary-fowlers-killer-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Villarreal: What Happened to Mary Fowlers Killer?">&larr;
