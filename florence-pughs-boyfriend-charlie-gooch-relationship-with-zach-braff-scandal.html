And given that she was one half of a highly publicized relationship, it's no wonder that fans wonder about what's going on in her personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Florence Pugh and Zach Braff's breakup</a> was big news as they dated from 2019 to 2022, and while people think that she is in a relationship with Charlie Gooch, who is a writer, director, and photographer in London, the actress has remained quiet about it. It seems that her romantic history with Braff could be the reason why.</p><h2 id=is-florence-pugh-dating-charlie-gooch>Is Florence Pugh Dating Charlie Gooch?</h2><p><a href=#>Fans focused on Pugh and Braff's age difference</a> and they received negative comments from people who didn't think that the then 24-year-old should be dating someone who was 44. Now that the actress might be in a new relationship, it's easy to wonder about it, but there appears to be a logical reason behind Pugh keeping silent.</p><p>The Daily Mail assumed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Florence Pugh had lunch with Charlie Gooch's family</a> in February 2023, as the rumored couple was photographed alongside Raffie, his sister, and Deborah, his mother. But while there are many photos of Pugh and Pooch, she hasn't confirmed the romance, and it doesn't appear that she wants to, given her desire for privacy after splitting up with Braff.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/florence-pugh.jpg><p>The actress famously told Harper's Bazaar that she isn't a reality star and so she shouldn't have to talk about her personal life.</p><p>It also seems like Pugh is tired of people assuming that she is in a relationship with someone just because they have starred in the same movie. According to In Touch Weekly, when photos were taken of her and Midsommar co-star Will Poulter at the beach, Pugh reacted to rumors that they were seeing each other.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Florence Pugh Called Out Her Own Fans And Haters</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pugh shared with fans, “This is getting a little silly now. No, Will Poulter and I are not dating. We went to the beach with our friends, who are always about half a metre away from us in every picture, but have been cleverly cut out/framed out so that it looks otherwise. You can LITERALLY see my best friend in the corner of so many shots and Archie’s arm at the sides. I understand that the nature of this job is that you sometimes get your privacy completely bulldozed by paparazzi, but to fabricate this stuff actually does more damage than good."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TT--(8).png><p>The actress can be commended for focusing on her acting, which is why fans love her in the first place, and deciding what she feels like sharing. Rather than telling fans who she's dating, she lets them see her fun and smart personality instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it would make sense if Pugh shunned social media altogether, she does have an Instagram account and posts fairly often for her 9 million followers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Florence-Pugh.jpg><p>Pugh's Instagram bio is quirkier and more interesting than most: she wrote, "Actor with a weirdly low voice and a confusing laugh. Occasionally cooks. Tzatziki goes with everything.. Fact." She posts photos from traveling and movie sets and often writes about how grateful she is for her career and for the people in her life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Florence Pugh And Zach Braff's Breakup A Good Thing For Her Career?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After being told that she was too young to date Zach Braff, and after people kept talking about their split, it makes sense that Florence Pugh would want to stop speaking about who she's seeing.</p><h2 id=florence-pugh-doesn-39-t-think-people-should-talk-about-her-relationships>Florence Pugh Doesn't Think People Should Talk About Her Relationships</h2><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Florence Pugh's January 2023 Vogue cover story</a>, she shared a bit about her split with Braff. She said that they didn't set out to have a public relationship and explained why there was so much scrutiny.</p><p>She said, “We weren’t in anyone’s faces. It was just that people didn’t like it. They imagined me with someone younger and someone in blockbusters."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/florence-pugh-black-widow.jpg><p>Pugh told Vanity Fair that she likes being real with people, and this is definitely why her fanbase appreciates her so much. She said that early on in her career, her grandfather was uncertain about her decision to be so open, but she always knew that this was the right way to go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/florence-pugh-zach-braff.jpg><p>She said, "My answer was like, 'Well, I’d much rather do it than they do it, and then I feel ashamed.' There’s no pretending with me. When I put on makeup and step in a wonderful dress, I give credit to the people that made me look like that, and I also want my fans to know that (a) I don’t look like that all the time and (b) I also have stress acne, and I also have hairy eyebrows, and I also have greasy hair."</p><p>Pugh continued to Vanity Fair, "I’ve always thought that was a way better way to do it. Just be honest and open—then no one has to call you out for anything. You are who you are."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Florence Pugh Really Felt About Working With Timothee Chalamet In Dune</a></span></p><p>The fact that the actress has starred in so many different kinds of movies proves that she cares about being herself. She seems to take on roles that feel right to her, even if someone else thinks that she should stick to one type of film.</p><p>After period pieces like Lady Macbeth, which was released in 2016, and Greta Gerwig's 2019 Little Women, Pugh joined the MCU and starred in Black Widow as Yelena Belova. This was a cool career choice that makes fans excited to see what she decides to do next.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/florence-pugh-dont-worry-darling.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans might want to know more about Florence Pugh's relationships, it doesn't seem that she's going to keep sharing. Thankfully does, she does let fans into some parts of her life, and she has posted sweet and hilarious cooking videos on her YouTube account Cooking With Flo. In one video, she makes butternut squash soup, and in another, she makes what she calls a "Cos lettuce spicy crunch feta thingy."</p><p>Even that recipe title alone proves how funny Pugh is, so even if she won't talk more about her love life, fans are definitely going to keep watching what she's doing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidpaeimruksYyprKCgo2KvsMXFq6CeppRisKmt0aWgnmWXpLyktIyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmr5mptW7GwJyfZpqilrOnedKcmKeckaF8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./heres-what-to-expect-from-quentin-tarantinos-last-movie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's What To Expect From Quentin Tarantino's &amp;quot;Last&amp;quot; Movie">&larr;
